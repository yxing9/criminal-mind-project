"Born in Amarillo Texas, adopted as the only child of Fred and Delle Albright"
"As a child he was doted upon and would be dressed in girl’s clothes and given a doll at times when his aunt was present. He was an impulsive child and would always manage to get out of the yard behind where his mother worked. She searched the fence and found no openings, but later learned he would wait for people passing by and simply would ask them to lift him over. Della ended up tying him to the porch to keep him away from the fence. "
"As soon as he received his first gun, he began shooting small animals such as squirrels and rabbits. He wanted to become a taxidermist and with Delle’s help, learned to skin and stuff animals but grew bored of small animals. As a teen he helped his mother in her real estate business"

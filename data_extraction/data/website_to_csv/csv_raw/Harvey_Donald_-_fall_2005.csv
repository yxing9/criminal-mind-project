04-15-1952,"0 Born in Booneville, Kentucky. Was the first of three children."
October,6 Head injury – father fell asleep holding him and dropped him.  He didn’t seem to
1952,"months be seriously injured, but his soft spot hadn’t closed."
"",Parents had an abusive relationship with each other.
"","Head injury – fell off running board of a truck.  He didn’t lose consciousness, but"
1957,5 years
"",had a cut 10-12 centimeters long on the back of the head.
"",Sexual abuse – Uncle Wayne (mother’s 1⁄2 brother) would abuse him when he went
"",Ages
1956-1972,to grandmother’s house.  Uncle Wayne primarily used Donald as an aid to
"",4-20
"","masturbation, but they also engaged in oral sex."
"",Ages Sexual abuse – an older neighbor (Dan Thomas) sexually abused him.  He noted
1957-1972,
"",5-20 later that he liked that Dan gave him money.
"",Received diploma from the American School (correspondence school in Chicago).
April 1968,16
"",Obtained his GED later this year.
1968,16 First sexual encounter in which he was an equal partner.
"",Started an occasional relationship with James Peluso which continued for about 15
1969,17
"",years.
1970,"18 Left home and moved to London, Kentucky."
05-11-1970,18 Started work at Marymount Hospital.
1970,18 Was raped by Randy White (roommate).
"",First kill – smothered Logan Evans (88) with a sheet of blue plastic and a pillow.
"",He listened to his heart rate with a stethoscope until he was dead.  He disposed of
05-30-1970,18
"","the plastic and cleaned him up, dressing him in a clean hospital gown.  He had no"
"",fear of getting caught and notified the nurse on duty.
"",Accidently killed James Tyree (69) by using the wrong size catheter on him.  Tyree
05-31-1970,"18 let him proceed, but then yelled at him to take it out.  Donald then used the heel of"
"",his hand to control him until he vomited blood and died.
"",Killed Elizabeth Wyatt (42).  This was his first “mercy kill” – he was aware that
"","she was praying to die.  She told him she wished she could die, so he turned her"
06-22-1970,18
"","oxygen supply very low in order to kill her.  Four hours later, a nurse found her"
"",dead.
"",Killed Eugene McQueen (43) by turning him on his stomach when he knew he
07-10-1970,18
"",wasn’t supposed to.  He drowned in his own fluids.  Harvey informed the nurse that
"",,"McQueen looked bad, but she said for him to continue.  Therefore he proceeded to"
"",,bathe him after he was dead in order to avoid suspicion.  This was covered up by
"",,"the hospital.  For as long as he worked at Marymount, the doctors and nurses teased"
"",,him for bathing a dead man.
"",,Accidently killed Harvey Williams (82) by using a faulty gas tank.  He went into
07-12-1970,18,
"",,cardiac arrest and died.
"",,Killed Ben Gilbert (81).  This was significant because it was his first premeditated
"",,murder.  Ben had knocked Donald unconscious with a urinal and poured its
"",,"contents over him, claiming that he thought Donald was a burglar.  Harvey"
"",,retaliated by catheterizing Gilbert using a female sized #20 catheter instead of the
07-24-1970,18,
"",,smaller #18 for men.  He then straightened out a coat hanger and shoved the wire
"",,"through the catheter about two feet, puncturing his bladder and bowel.  He went"
"",,"into instant shock, breaking into a cold sweat and going into a coma.  Harvey"
"",,disposed of the wire and replaced the #20 catheter with a #18.
07-28-1970,18,Ben Gilbert died.
"",,Started a 7 month relationship with Vernon Midden.  Vernon was an undertaker
"",,that was married with children.  Vernon taught Donald lots of ins and outs of how
1970,18,
"",,the body reacts when certain things are done to it (ex. when it is smothered).  This
"",,came in handy when he was trying to get away with his murders.
"",,"Vernon (his lover) introduced Donald to the occult, but wouldn’t let him take part"
1970,18,
"",,in the rituals because he wasn’t a member.
"",,Killed Maude Nichols using a faulty oxygen tank.  She had been sent there with
08-15-1970,18,bed sores so bad that maggots crawled in the sores.  No one wanted to give her
"",,"care, so he killed her."
"",,Killed William Bowling (58) by not turning his oxygen on.  He had been brought
"",,to the hospital due to difficulty breathing.  Donald’s action was intentional but
08-30-1970,18,
"",,spontaneous.  He wanted to end the patient’s struggles to breathe.  He died of a
"",,massive heart attack.
"",,Killed Viola Reed Wyan (63) using a faulty oxygen tank.  He commented that she
"",,smelled bad.  She was suffering from leukemia and electrolyte imbalance.  He
11-04-1970,18,"decided to end her suffering, so he attempted to kill her by plastic and pillow"
"",,"smothering, but someone came in and he had to stop.  Therefore, he got the faulty"
"",,oxygen tank and killed her that way.
"",,"Killed Margaret Harrison (91) by giving her an overdose of Demerol, morphine,"
12-07-1970,18,and codeine that was intended for another patient.  He monitored her pulse until it
"",,dropped to 0 and she stopped breathing.
January,,Relationship with Vernon Midden began to go sour.  He became depressed and
"",18,
1971,,fantasized about embalming Vernon alive.
"",,Killed Sam Carroll (80) using a faulty oxygen tank.  He had pneumonia and an
01-09-1971,18,obstruction of his small intestine.  Donald decided he had suffered enough and
"",,retrieved the faulty oxygen tank.
"",,Killed Maggie Rawlins by smothering her with a pillow.  He put a plastic bag
01-15-1971,18,between her face and a pillow in order to avoid fibers in her airways.  She was
"",,treated for a bad burn on her arm.
"",,Killed Silas Butner (62) using a faulty oxygen tank.  He had been experiencing
"",,"kidney problems.  He had attempted to kill him multiple times by smothering him,"
01-23-1971,18,
"",,"but each time was interrupted.  There was an autopsy in this case, but the true cause"
"",,of death was never discovered.
"",,Killed John V. Combs (68) using a faulty gas tank.  He had a bad heart and
"",,"difficulty breathing.  Tried to smother him with a plastic bag unsuccessfully, so"
01-26-1971,18,
"",,returned to the faulty oxygen tank.  Donald described this killing as a “mercy”
"",,killing.
"",,Killed Milton Bryant Sasser (90) by giving him an overdose of morphine that he
03-14-1971,18,had stolen from the cabinet at the nurse’s station.  He had been brought in for
"",,congestive heart failure.  Donald made the mistake fo trying to dispose of the
"",,"hypodermic needle in a toilet, stopping it up.  The maintenance man discovered theneedle.  However, no one recognized a connection between the needle and Sasser’sdeath."
03-27-1971,18,Last day at Marymount Hospital.  (Reason unknown)
June 1971,19,"Arson – set a fire in the bathroom of an empty apartment in the building where helived because he was depressed.  This was an unsuccessful suicide attempt inwhich he tried to kill himself through asphyxiation.  He was arrested and paid a$50 fine."
1971,19,"First heterosexual encounter with Ruth Anne Hodges, the daughter of a family hewas staying with while in Frankfort, Kentucky applying for a job.  They weredrunk, and he doesn’t remember what happened, although he does remember beingnaked with her.  Nine months later, she had a son in which she named Donald asthe father.  At times he has talked about his 2 children, but at other times he hasdenied they exist."
1971,19,"Was arrested for suspicion of burglary in his apartment building; the real reason forthe arrest was to question Donald about the occult.  Donald actually admitted to thepolice to killing 15 people at Marymount Hospital, but no one believed him."
06-16-1971,19,Enlisted in the Air Force.
1971,19,"Sexual encounter with Jim.  This was significant because Donald said he had anurge to kill Jim, but refrained because his deterrent was a fear of getting caught, notan aversion to killing."
1971,19,Tried to commit suicide using an overdose of NyQuil because he was depressed.
03-09-1972,19,"Discharged from the Air Force was classified as medical reasons, under honorableconditions.  The overdose of NyQuil led to the Air Force finding out about hisarrest and resulted in therapy and ultimately his discharge."
1972,19,"Tried to commit suicide using Placydil and Equanil because he was depressed dueto an argument with his family.  Was taken to the hospital and his stomach waspumped.  He was then transferred to the VA hospital as an inpatient when hisparents told him he was no longer welcome at their house.  Was then treated as amoutpatient."
1972,19,"Began working at Cardinal Hill Convalescent Hospital in Lexington, Kentucky.He worked there for five months full-time and another two years part-time.  He didnot kill anyone while working there."
1972-1973,19-20,"Began dating Russell Addison.  They lived together and had a 10-monthrelationship."
1973-1978,20-25,"Began a 5-year intermittent relationship with Ken Estes.  They lived together forportions of this."
"",,Became more interested in the occult.
"September1975",23,Obtained a job as a nursing assistant at the VA Hospital in Lexington.
1975,23,"Donald reduced oxygen flow of Joseph Harris, possibly resulting in his death(although he was never indicted for this)."
1975,23,"James Twitty, James Ritter, Harry Rhodes, and Sterling Moore died in the ward.Donald believes he had something to do with their deaths but doesn’t rememberany specifics."
June 1977,25,"Joined occult through an initiation that is only available for heterosexual couples.Therefore he was hooked up with “Jan” as his partner and the two of them wereinitiated by switching partners with a couple already in the occult.  This resulted inthe conception of his second child.  During this initiation, he received his spiritualguide, Duncan, that would assist him in figuring out who to kill.  Duncan was adoctor during his lifetime."
1980,28,"Began dating Doug Hill.  They heatedly argued often, and after one fight, Donaldretaliated by slipping arsenic into Doug’s ice cream.  This was significant becauseit was the first person outside of the hospital he had tried to harm."
08-01-1980,28,Started a relationship with Carl Hoeweler.  They moved in together.
"",,When Donald found out that Carl had been going to the park every Monday and
1980,28,"“playing around” with other men, he started feeding him small doses of arsenic to"
"",,make him sick on Sunday so that he couldn’t go to the park on Monday.
"",,Donald thought that Diane (Carl’s “faghag”) was trying to split up their
"",,relationship so he gave her hepatitis B that he stole from the VA hospital.  He also
1980,28,
"",,poisoned her with acrylic acid and tried to infect her with AIDS he stole as well
"",,(but it didn’t work).
"",,"Killed Helen Metzger (WF, 63) because he thought she was a threat to Carl and an"
"",,indirect threat to him.  He did this by sprinkling arsenic on the leftovers he gave her
1983,,
"",,and in a jar of mayonnaise as well.  Several weeks later he gave her more in a pie.
(death:,,
"",31,She developed a paralysis and moved upwards.  He claims he didn’t mean to give
"April 10,",,
"",,"her a lethal dose, but the paralysis set in.  Following a tracheotomy, she started"
1983),,
"",,hemorrhaging and never regained consciousness.  Her death was attributed to
"",,Guillain-Barre Syndrome.
"",,Helen’s family got sick due to the arsenic in the mayonnaise after the gathering at
1983,31,her apartment after the funeral.  No one died and it was believed to be food
"",,poisoning.
"April 25,",,
1983,,"Killed Carl’s father, Henry Howeler (WM, 82) by giving him arsenic.  He died four"
"",31,
(death: May,,days later due to a stroke and kidney failure.
"1, 1983)",,
"",,Accidentally killed Howard Vetter (Carl’s brother-in-law).  Donald had been using
"",,wood alcohol to remove adhesive labels and left the solution in a vodka bottle.
Late 1983 –,,
"",31,Carl got hold of the wrong bottle and served Howard a few drinks from it.  He was
early 1984,,
"",,"sick for a week, and suffered a heart attack.  His death was attributed to cardiac"
"",,failure.
"",,Accidentally killed Hiram Proffit by giving him the wrong dosage of heparin.  He
09-19-1984,32,
"",,told no one about the error and it was not detected.
"",,"Killed ex-boyfriend James Peluso (WM, 65) because he asked him to “help him"
"",,out” if he ever became unable to care for himself.  He gave him arsenic in a
11-09-1984,32,daiquiri and in some pudding.  He became ill again at home and was returned to the
"",,"VA hospital.  His death had been expected due to cardiac problems, so no autopsy"
"",,was performed.
"March 18,",,
1985,,"Killed Edward Wilson, a neighbor, because he wanted to protect Carl.  Wilson"
(death:,32,"believed that Carl was cheating him on his utility bills.  In order to protect Carl, he"
"March 23,",,put arsenic into Wilson’s Pepto-Bismol. He died 5 days later.
1985,,
March 1985,32,Promoted to morgue supervisor.
"",,"Joined National Socialist Party (neo-Nazi).  Later claimed he wasn’t a sympathizer,"
1985,32,
"",,but instead was there gathering info for friends that wanted to destroy the party.
"",,"Was fired from VA hospital because they found a gun in his gym bag, which was"
"",,strictly against policy.  They also found a small specimen of liver mounted in
July 1985,33,paraffin wax to be sliced with a microtome for microscopic examination in his
"",,"locker.  Due to errors in the investigation, none of this appeared on his record."

"",,"Killed Nathani J. Watson (BM, 65) by smothering him with a wet, plastic garbage"
"",,"can liner which he placed over his face, pushing it into his mouth and into his"
"",,"nostrils.  He had tried to kill him in the same manner multiple times, but was"
04-08-1986,33,"interrupted each time.  He didn’t think that Watson, a semi-comatose man being"
"",,"fed through a gastric tube, should live that way.  He had also heard that Watson"
"",,was a convicted rapist (even though this was never substantiated).  He removed the
"",,pillow and threw the plastic bag in the trash and carried on to his next patient.
"",,Watson was found 3⁄4 of an hour later by a nurse.

"",,An autopsy was performed.
"",,"The autopsy for John Powell was conducted by Dr. Lee Lehman, a forensic"
"",,"psychologist who had a background in biochemistry, knowing specifically about"
"",,cyanide.  This meant that he knew exactly what cyanide smelled like and how to
"",,identify that smell.  He cut open John Powell and immediately smelled the smell of
03-08-1987,34,
"",,bitter almonds (the smell of cyanide) and knew that foul play was afoot.  He then
"",,proceeded with the autopsy and send samples to other labs in order to confirm what

"",,confirmation confirmed what he had thought.
March 1987,34,The Cincinnati Police Department was notified.
"",,Investigations of John Powell’s death began.  First his food supply was looked into.
"",,The his wife was questioned.  Nurses at the hospital were interviewed and during
"",,"one of these interviews, Donald Harvey’s name was brought up because of his"
"",,questionable ending of employment at the VA Hospital.  Hospital employees at this
"",,"time were volunteering to take polygraph tests, and Donald volunteered to take one"
March-,,after buying a book on how to beat lie detector tests.  He called in sick the day of
"",34,
April 1987,,"his scheduled appointment and did not take the test.  Since he did not take the test,"
"",,Donald was brought in for questioning.  Detectives Jim Lawson and Ron Camden
"",,"questioned him for a while, playing a bit of “good cop, bad cop,” until finally"
"",,Donald confessed to having put cyanide in John Powell’s G-tube.  He explained
"",,that it was because he felt sorry for him and for his family.  He denied having ever
"",,done that for anyone else.
"",,Donald was indicted for aggravated first degree murder of John Powell.  Soon after
04-06-1987,34,
"",,"this, William Whalen was appointed his public defender."
"",,"Competency hearing was conducted by Dr. Schmidtgoessling and Roger Fisher, a"
"",,clinical psychologist.  Roger Fisher concluded that Harvey knew the difference
"",,between right and wrong and was able to conform to the conduct of the law.  He
05-26-1987,35,
"",,also concluded that Donald was free of any emotional disease or defect of the
"",,mind.  Dr. Schmidtgoessling concluded that Donald had a history of depression
"",,"because of childhood experiences, but he was not and never had been psychotic."
"",,"On WCPO-TV evening news, Pat Minarcin questioned another reporter on the air"
"",,about possibility that Harvey had been responsible for other deaths at Drake
"",,Hospital.  He then started receiving anonymous phone calls from nurses detailing
"",,other deaths Donald had caused.  He then met with the nurses and started
"",,investigating even more.  He denied all of his investigations to the superintendent
June 1987,35,"of the hospital because the nurses feared repercussions, since the hospital had"
"",,stopped its investigations.  He discovered that the pattern of deaths and Harvey’s
"",,"work schedule was very similar.  He had all of this information, but couldn’t use"
"",,any of it on the air.  He went to Whalen and informed him of his story.  This sent
"",,Whalen into a frenzy of trying to find out everything that happened and getting a
"",,plea bargain set.
June 1987,35,Whalen did not consider an insanity plea – Donald didn’t want it.
"",,Whalen worked out a plea bargain that included that he confess to all of the
June 1987,35,murders he had committed in return for taking the death penalty off the table.  If he
"",,"left any of his murders out, the deal was off the table."

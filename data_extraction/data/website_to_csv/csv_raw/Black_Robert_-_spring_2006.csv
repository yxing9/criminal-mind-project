"",Was in care before being fostered to Jack and Margaret Tulip in the Highlands.
"October,","6 Tulips lived in Kinlochleven, near Glencoe in the West Highlands. Robert lived"
1947,"months here for the next eleven years, the majority of which were spent in the care of"
"",Margaret Tulip.
"","Jack Tulip died.  Black claims to have no memory of him, indeed, no memories at"
"",all before the age of five.  Although locals remember how Robert Black was
"","frequently heavily bruised as a boy, Black himself cannot recall how he got these"
"","injuries.  He recalls no abusive behavior from Jack, though he does remember how"
"","Margaret used to lock him in the house as a punishment for bad behavior, or"
1952,5 yrs.
"","alternatively, pull down his trousers and underwear and spank him with a belt.  At"
"","nights Robbie was scared that there was a monster under his bed waiting to get him,"
"","and used to suffer from a recurring nightmare featuring a ""big hairy monster"" in a"
"","cellar full of water.  When he awoke he frequently found that he had wet the bed,"
"",which invariably provoked a beating.
"",To his classmates at primary school Robert - or 'Smelly Robbie Tulip' as he was
"",
"",known - is remembered as having been an aggressive and slightly wayward boy.
"","Having said this, in the period that he was living with the Tulips, Robert never"
"","really got himself into any serious trouble: he had childish fights, played up at"
"",
"","school, and bullied the younger children, yet he seemed to avoid anything more"
"",serious than a rebuke from Williams for swearing in front of ladies.
"","His first sexual experience, which is one of his first memories, was when he was"
"",only five.  Black vividly recalls himself and a little girl undressing and looking at
"",each other's sexual parts
"","Highland Dance classes, he remembers being far more interested in lying on the"
1954,7 yrs
"",floor and looking up the girls’ skirts than dancing.
"","While looking after a neighbor's baby, he took off her nappy to look at her vagina."
1955,"8 yrs Both vaginas and anuses fascinated him, and he was obsessed with discovering how"
"","big they were, how much they could hold."
"",Margaret Tulip died.  Once again deprived of a mother.  Although a local couple
1958,"11 yrs. offered to take him in, it was decided that Black would go to the Redding Children's"
"","Home near Falkirk, close to the place of his birth."
1959,12 yrs Black made his first inept attempt at rape.
"",,"He told Ray Wyre: ""Me and two other boys went into a field with a girl the same"
"",,"age.  We took her knickers off, lifted her skirt and all tried to put our penises in."""
"",,"Finding that they couldn't complete the act of penetration, the boys contented"
"",,themselves instead with touching the girl's vagina.  When asked if she was
"",,"consenting to this, Black told Wyre: ""I was forcing her, like, you know?""  The"
"",,incident was exposed and the authorities decided that Black would be better suited
"",,"to a home with stricter discipline, not to mention an all-male environment."
"",12 yrs.,"Red House in Musselburgh.  For at least a year, possibly two, out of the three that"
1959-,,

1962,,
"",yrs.,abused him.
"",,During this time Robert had obtained a place at Musselburgh Grammar School.
"",,"Slightly above average academically, but it was sport that he was really interested"
"",,
"",,"in, especially football, swimming and athletics."
"",,"His time at the Red House was up.  With help from authorities, Black got a job as a"
Summer,,"delivery boy and found a room to rent in a boys’ home in Greenock, outside"

"",,attempted murder.
"",,"Approached a 7-year-old girl in the park, asking her if she would like to go with him"
"",,to see some kittens.  Girl trustingly followed him as he led her to a deserted
"",,building.  Choked her until unconscious and raped her.  Left after he was done.  She
1964,17 yrs.,"was found later wandering the streets:  bleeding, crying and confused."
"",,"Case was brought to court and astoundingly Black was given an admonishment, a"
"",,"verdict particular to Scottish law, which is effectively no more than a warning to be"
"",,on good behavior in the future.
"",,Lost job.  Moved to Kinlochleven
March,,Found guilty of three counts of indecent assault and sentenced to a year of Borstal
"",20yrs.,
1967,,"training to be served at Polmont, near Grangemouth."

"",,"Obsession with young girls was growing, fuelled by his discovery of child"
"",,pornography.  Discovered that magazines such as Teenage Sex and Lollitots were
"",,clandestinely available.
"",,"Favorite job was that of swimming pool attendant, where he was sometimes able to"

"",,
"",,lodge up his anus.

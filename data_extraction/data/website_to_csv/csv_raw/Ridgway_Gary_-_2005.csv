"02-18-1949 0 Born. Also has two brothers, Gregory L. and Thomas E. Live in Salt Lake City,"
Utah.
His parents did not mingle in the neighborhood nor invited people into their home.
"Gary’s ex-wives mostly spoke of negative experiences with his parents, especially"
with his mother. She exhibited a domineering attitude towards her son which
caused frequent disagreements within his parent’s marriage. She once got so mad at
"her husband that she broke a plate over his head to which he did not retaliate, but"
"rather just left the room. However, Gary was closer to his mother than he was his"
father.
"An ex-wife stated that his mother dressed in tight clothes, wore excessive makeup"
and looked like a prostitute. Gary would later admit to detectives of his feelings of
sexual attraction to his mother as well as feelings of lust and humiliation.
Gary kept his mother on his checking account even after he got married and always
checked with his mother before making any major purchase.

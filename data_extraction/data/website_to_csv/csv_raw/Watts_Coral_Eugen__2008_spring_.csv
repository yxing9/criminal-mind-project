Born in Killeen Texas to Richard and Dorothy Mae.  Richard was a private in the
"army and was transferred to “Texas Bermuda Triangle” and in 1942, before Carl"
11/07/1953 0
"was born, Killeen was selected to be the location for its Tank Destroyer Tactical"
and Firing center.
"11/10/1953 3 d. Moved back to Coalwood, West Virginia"
11/10/1954? 1 His sister Sharon Yvonne was born
Richard left Dorothy and the kids forever and gave no reason.  They then moved
"to Inkster, Michigan.  Dorothy then worked as an art teacher and went to"
"Coalwood to visit her mother, Lula Mae Young, a lot.  Carl loved visiting his"
grandmother.  He acquired his nickname because his cousins had an accent and
would draw out the letters in Carl’s name until it sounded like Coral and Carl
1955 2
decided that he liked it and also started talking like that.  A coral reef is a
beautiful organism that is dangerous to the touch and Carl asked his mother to
"change it.  He liked hunting jackrabbits with his grandfather.  In Inkster, Coral"
struggled in school but tried very hard with his homework and earned good
grades.
Coral and Sharon got meningitis (an inflammation of the membrane that
surrounds the brain and spinal cord and is caused by a viral infection).  The
"hospital that their mother took them to, Detroit General Hospital, took Sharon"
but refused to see Coral.  He then got a horrible fever and had to go to Herman
1961 8
Keifer Hospital for a while because he now had meningitis and polio.  He had to
be kept separate from other patients and had to get spinal taps.  He missed the
entire 3rd grade and his attention span dropped and grades suffered.  Coral
complained his memory often failed him now too.
Dorothy got remarried to a man named Norman Ceaser who had 6 kids of his
own.  They then had 2 more kids.  Coral didn’t get much attention because he
"1962 9 didn’t stand out; he was shy, quiet, and introverted.  Coral kept everything inside"
and when he got upset he was volatile.  He wasn’t violent or abusive and was
never abused by his parents.  Coral got his frustrations out through the love of
"",,sports.  He was an excellent baseball and football player and track star.  He won
"",,aa Golden Gloves boxing title in the middleweight division but the first time he
"",,got knocked out he gave up.
1968,15,He was reading at a 4th grade level and he didn’t seem to care anymore.
"",,He had his first run-in with the law.  He was a paper delivery boy in Detroit and
"",,"attacked a 26 year old white woman, Gave, one morning for no reason.  He"
06/25/1969,15,"punched her in the face until she screamed and then he left, continued his"
"",,delivery and went home.  Four days later he was arrested at his home and said “I
"",,just felt like beating someone up”.
"",,Taken to Lafayette Mental Clinic which is a forensic psychiatry center in Detroit.
"",,He had sex at 14 but didn’t have much interest in girls.  He was told sex is
"",,wicked behavior.  When he was evaluated it was said that he experienced
"",,disturbing dreams of beating up women and even killing them and he feels better
09/02/1969,15,after having the dreams.  Several weeks later he still didn’t feel remorse for
"",,attacking Gave.  It was said by a doctor that he was impulsive and had a passive-
"",,aggressive orientation to life and no evidence of psychosis.  He’s a paranoid man
"",,who is struggling for control over homicidal impulses.  The doctor recommended
"",,outpatient treatment.
11/07/1969,16,Coral was released from Lafayette Mental Clinic on his birthday.
"",,Went back to Lafayette Mental Clinic fewer than 10 times for his outpatient
"",,"treatment.  Began to get mixed in with drugs, withdrew from friends, and got in"
"",16-,
1969-1974,,trouble in school because of his behavior with girls.  He still played football and
"",21,
"",,boxing and said that’s how he dealt with abusive parents although everyone in
"",,his family denies abuse.
09/06/1972,18,"Zenaida Tomes (20) is found stabbed too death in Taylor, Michigan"
"",,Graduated with the help of his mother and received a scholarship to play football
"",,"for Lane college in Tennessee.  Lane college was predominantly black, he was"
"",,the running back until he had a severe knee injury and wasn’t able to play
1973,19,
"",,anymore.  He dropped out after three months and moved back to Detroit with his
"",,mother and step father for six months.  He became a mechanic for E & L
"",,Transport.
"",,Went to Lafayette Mental Clinic for a checkup and said he was still suffering
"",,from his problems.  His psychological evaluation said he might have problems
1974,20,
"",,with his sexuality and there were hints of homosexuality and he had a strong
"",,impulse to beat up women.
"",,Enrolled in college courses at Western Michigan University.  He was accepted
"",,under the MLK grant program for minorities.  He was studying engineering and
07/02/1974,20,
"",,worked in the University cafeteria.  He slacked off in class and spent his time
"",,playing ping pong.  He intensely hated females even more than before.
"",,He was caught stealing plywood from the WMU campus.  The school police
10/11/1974,20,
"",,arrested him but they didn’t press charges.
"",,"Coral knocked on Lenore Knizacky’s apartment door at 10:45 am, with the door"
"",,"still chained she opened the door and Coral asked for Charles, which was the"
"",,name of one of his siblings.  No one named Charles lived there and she told him
10/25/1974,20,to check some neighbor’s places and he did but then he came back.  She asked if
"",,he’d like to leave a note and she undid the chain lock and went to get paper.
"",,Coral slipped in and attacked Knizacky.  He got on top of her and choked her
"",,until she passed out and then he left.
"",,"Gloria Steel (BF, 19) was murdered.  She was a mother and a student at WMU."
"",,She was stabbed 33 times in the chest with a wooden carving tool and had a
"",,crushed windpipe.  There were no witnesses except for a woman who saw a
10/30/1974,20,
"",,black man walk up the staircase and he said he was looking for Charles.  The
"",,police could not do an investigation because someone moved the evidence and
"",,body.
11/12/1974,21,"Diane K. Williams, an apartment resident manager, noticed a black man"
"",,wandering around the apartment complex who was “looking for Charles” and
"",,Coral knocked on her door and asked for Charles.  She got a piece of paper and
"",,Coral took it from her and forced the door open and pushed Williams into her
"",,apartment.  While the two were fighting her phone began to ring so she knocked
"",,it off the hook and screamed for help.  Her husband’s secretary was on the other
"",,end and the man took off running.  Williams stood up and looked out her
"",,window and saw the man getting into a tan Pontiac Grand Prix.  A lineup was
"",,put together and Williams and Knizacky identified Coral.
11/16/1974,21,Coral was arrested and charged with assault and battery for both cases.
"",,He admitted that he was in the area of where Gloria lived the day before she died
11/18/1974,21,
"",,but he said he did not kill her.
"",,Arrested for stealing the plywood from WMU but he kept his mouth shut and
11/21/1974,21,
"",,was released on bond.
"",,Coral was interviewed by Ninth District Court investigator Freemire.  Coral
"",,admitted to attacking about 15 other young women.  Most of the women were
12/6/1974,21,"thin, attractive and white.  After a while he demanded a lawyer, the person to"
"",,represent him was Plaszcak.  Coral decided he wanted to admit himself into the
"",,Kalamazoo Mental Hospital.
"",,Detroit police had a search warrant for Watts’ home and they found wooden
12/12/1974,21,
"",,carving tools but nothing to tie him to Gloria’s murder.
"",,Watts had to stay in jail for 45 days or go to Kalamazoo Mental Hospital for the
"",,larceny of the plywood.  Watts chose to stay in the hospital.  Watts liked staying
"",,"in the hospital too much, he shot pool and played basketball.  Many doctors"
12/18/1974,21,"checked out Coral and said he doesn’t believe in God, ESP, he hasn’t heard any"
"",,"voices, didn’t have delusions, there weren’t psychotic symptoms noticed and"
"",,"mental facilities were intact.  One of the doctors, Katilius, said Coral suffered"
"",,from antisocial personality disorder.
"",,Coral tried to kill himself or tried to make the doctors think he wanted to kill
"",,himself.  He got a laundry bag cord and hung himself when a nurse saw him and
1/8/1975,21,
"",,cut him down.  He wasn’t unconscious.  He was released later and worked
"",,sweeping up a local church.
"",,Admitted to the Center for Forensic Psychiatry in Michigan.  A doctor Benedek
"",,said that Watts usually feels good after he beats up women.  She didn’t think he
6/1975,21,had a mental illness and said he was competent to stand trial.  She also said he is
"",,dangerous and the potential for recidivism is high.  He stated that what he did to
"",,the women didn’t bother him.
"",,His trial for the assault and battery of Knizacky and Williams.  He pleaded “no
12/19/1975,22,
"",,contest” and went to the county jail for one year.
"",,"He was released from the jail, returned to Inkster, and moved in with his mother"
8/24/1976,22,"and stepfather.  Coral hooked up with a childhood friend, Deloris Howard, and"
"",,got her pregnant.
"",,About 5 attacks on women in Detroit with about the same modus operandi every
June-Oct 1978,,"time.  Break into women’s homes, the women would wake up to a man standing"
"",,"over them with his hands on their mouths, breasts, or genitals."
"",,Had a daughter with Deloris and named her Nakisha Watts.  They had a
"",,seemingly healthy relationship but he was really a deadbeat dad.  He wouldn’t
2/3/1979,25,
"",,claim Nakisha as his own and took off.  Later Deloris filed a claim to get $70 a
"",,week from Coral for child support.
"",,Coral married Valeria Goodwill and they moved in together on Parker Street in
"",,Detroit.  Coral’s mom didn’t like Valeria very much and eventually Valeria
"",,didn’t like Coral either.  She said that he had nightmares or something in his
8/17/1979,25,sleep and it would be like he was fighting someone in his sleep.  She also said he
"",,would also fall out of bed or the couch and get back in without waking up.  If
"",,Valeria touched him while he was waking up he would jump and she had to get
"",,out of the way.  Soon after their marriage he began to act strangely.  He would
"",,"constantly rearrange the furniture, cut up house plants with knives, cut candles"
"",,"and melt them into the table, dump garbage all over the floors and not pick it up."
"",,After they would have sex or an “intimate encounter” he would get up and leave
"",,and be gone for hours at a time.

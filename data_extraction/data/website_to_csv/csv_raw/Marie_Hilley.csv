01/18/1932,"Marie’s parents, Huey and Lucille Frazier, were married"
"","Born as Audrey Marie Frazier in Anniston, Alabama to Huey and Lucille Frazier. Because her parents"
06/04/1933,0
"","worked long hours, she spent most of her childhood being raised by her two aunts."
"",Her parents denied her nothing and enforced little to no discipline.  She was described as throwing violent
"",tantrums whenever anyone tried to admonish her.  Her parents allowed her to sleep in their bed “well past
"","the age where children learn to sleep through the night in their own beds” (McDonald, 1986)."
"",Attended Quintard Junior High School and was elected as the “prettiest girl” in the school. Began a
1946,12
"","contentious relationship with Frank Alfred Hilley, a junior in high school."
05/08/1951,17 Married Frank Hilley while he was on leave from the Navy.
"","While Frank was in Guam, he sent her every one of his paychecks for her to save.  She spent the money"
1952,18
"",without telling him.
"","Moved briefly to California with Frank.  When he was discharged from the Navy, they moved back to"
"",
"",Anniston.  Described time in California as the happiest in her life.
"",Marie gets a job as a secretary and Frank found work as a shipping clerk.
11/11/1952,"19 After being in labor for almost two days, Marie gave birth to Michael D. Hilley."
"","Followed the trial of Nancy Hazel Doss, a.k.a. The Giggling Granny, who had killed her 4 husbands, 2"
05/17/1955,21
"","children, 2 sisters, mother, grandson, and nephew by slowly poisoning them with arsenic."
"",Began to privately taunt Frank with letters she claimed were love letters from other men.  She showed him
"","the letters, but refused to let him read them.  Then she tore them up in front of him, but left the remains"
1959,
"","where he could find them.  Frank found that she had written them all herself.  When confronted, she"
"",confessed that she had done it because she was afraid he didn’t love her anymore.
"",Spent more than twice her monthly take-home pay from her job as a secretary on clothes and luxury items.
"",
"","Checked the mail early and hid the bills away from Frank, who was very fiscally responsible."
1959,"While pregnant with Carol Hilley, often wandered around aimlessly in the front yard at night."
01/14/1960,26 Gave birth to Carol Marie Hilley.
"",Marie was openly disappointed in Carol’s plain looks and unwillingness to wear the dresses she bought for
"",
"",her.
"","Insisted upon moving to a house on McClellan Boulevard, closer to the houses belonging to the wealthier"
1962,
"",residents of Anniston.
"",Huey and Lucille moved in with the Hilleys.
"","Huey died of cancer in Anniston, AL, at the age of 57.  Lucille continued to live with Marie until her own"
12/11/1965,
"",death.
"","Evidence of a possible extramarital affair, according to her sister-in-law.  (Marie suddenly asked to live"
"",,"with her.  While she was there, she was observed leaving with a strange man.)"
1971,,"Son, Michael, graduates from high school"
1972,,"Marie purchased a $25,000 life insurance policy for Michael, of which she was the sole beneficiary."
"",,"After Michael went to college, she and Frank fostered a child named Maria Alexander, for whom thecounty paid a monthly stipend.  Objects around the house began to vanish with no explanation (e.g., cutsof meat from the freezer, appliances, small household items)"
1973,,"Marie suspected that that her daughter, Carol, was a lesbian.  Prone to sudden, violent rages at Carol’sfemale friends.  Began to refuse to allow Franks friends to talk to him on the telephone.  (Probably beganlacing Frank’s food with arsenic at this point.)"
05/19/1975,41,"Frank called Michael (who was living in Florida) and said he needed to tell him something that was tooimportant to talk about over the phone.  They agreed to meet in Georgia the following weekend.  Mariehad eavesdropped on the conversation via an extension.  Frank’s symptoms worsened severelyimmediately afterward."
05/19/1975,41,"Frank Hilley goes to see his doctor, complaining of nausea."
05/22/1975,41,"Dr. Earl Jones prescribed a medication in capsule form to reduce stomach spasms for what he believed tobe Frank’s viral stomach infection.  Marie told Frank’s sister, Freeda, that he had prescribed medication tobe delivered via injection and authorized her to administer it."
05/23/1975,41,Frank Hilley is admitted to the Regional Medical Center.
05/25/1975,41,"Frank Hilley (45) succumbed to arsenic poisoning while at the Regional Medical Center.  The autopsystated that he had died of infectious hepatitis."
"",,"Following Frank’s death, filed a claim for $31,140 in life insurance of which she was the sole beneficiary.Bought a series of lavish purchases such as a car, a motorcycle, and new furniture for the entire house."
1976,,"Michael and his wife, Teri, moved in with Marie in order to help care for Lucille, who had become ill."
"",,"The household began to receive anonymous, threatening notes written in crude, childish handwriting.  Thenotes stated that horrible things would happen to the Hilley family if they did not leave Anniston.  Theneighbor, Doris Ford, received similar notes.  Marie reported numerous cases of vandalism to herinsurance company and collected payments.  She was later found to have written the notes and committedthe vandalism."
1976,,"Probably poisoned Teri, causing her to lose her baby.  (Her symptoms matched those of Marie’s otherconfirmed poisoning victims.)  Michael and Teri moved out."
09/05/1976,43,"House caught fire while no one was home.  Sued the Alabama Gas Company for $75,000.  Lost thelawsuit, but collected insurance."
"",43,"Lucille Frazier’s health worsened.  Marie offered to help administer painkillers via injection.  Evidencesuggests that Marie had been poisoning her.  (Four times the safe amount of arsenic was found in her liverwhen she was exhumed in the investigation of Frank Hilley’s death.)"
01/04/1977,43,"Lucille Frazier succumbed to a widespread, aggressive cancer.  (Arsenic is a known carcinogen.)  Mariecollected $600 from a small burial policy."
"",,"Vandalism of the Hilley and Ford homes escalated to window-breaking and screen-cutting.  Both beganreceiving telephone calls consisting of nothing but heavy breathing.  Marie blamed the 18-year old son ofone of her neighbors.  She claimed that he had stolen nine pieces of valuable jewelry, two gold candlestickholders, a revolver, a tear gas gun, and a hairdryer.  She just happened to have pictures of every piece ofjewelry stolen, which she used when filing the insurance claim."
"",,"Contacted the Anniston Police Department almost daily for the next two years, complaining of harassment,vandalism, burglary, and eventually extortion attempts.  Accused neighbors, friends of Carol, and formeremployers.  A trace on her phone line showed that at least one of the calls came from a telephone boothacross the street from her house.  During this time, Marie experimented on the detectives involved in hercase by bringing them cakes and cookies laced with varying doses of arsenic."
06/17/1977,44,"Marie contacted Detective Gary Caroll of the Anniston Police Department reporting smelling gas fumes ather house.  He described her as very polite, soft-spoken, religious, and vulnerable.  An investigation by thegas company found that there was a valve underneath her house which would release gas if depressed."
"",44,"Detective Caroll noticed that the harassing calls would stop whenever the trace was on, and start again assoon as it had been taken off.  Marie told him she suspected that someone at the phone company wasinvolved."
"",44,"Claimed that one of her former employers attempted to force her to have oral sex with him, and put forththe idea that he was responsible for the harassment.  Told Detective Donnie Williams that two men had"
"",,"come by her house shortly after Frank’s death, demanding $30,000 or $40,000 in payment for gamblingdebts. Marie told Detective Caroll that the harassment was to get them to move because K-mart wasbuilding a store on their street.  No phone calls occurred while Carol was at home."
"",44,"Later calls made to Doris Ford were traced to the Jenkins Manufacturing Plant, where Marie was workingas a secretary."
07/22/1977,44,"An early morning fire broke out in the Hilley house.  It was found to have been set in a closet facingCarol’s bedroom door.  A similar fire broke out in the closet of the Ford home a short while later, whileMarie and Carol were staying there.  Marie accused Doris Ford’s boyfriend of starting the fires (eventhough he couldn’t have gotten into the Hilley house without breaking in)."
"",44,"Sold her house for a much smaller amount than it was worth so that she could close the sale with cash.Moved with Carol to an apartment and obtained an unlisted phone number"
08/03/1977,44,"Informed Detective Caroll that she was still getting calls even though she had only given her new phonenumber to Doris Ford,  Freeda Adcock, and one of Carol’s friends."
"",44,"Detectives Williams and Caroll began to feel uncomfortable about Marie’s constant calls, and suspectedthat she might be fabricating things.  They concluded amongst themselves that the Hilleys didn’t seem tobe in real danger anymore."
"",44,"Investigators traced three of the calls Marie reported to the home of one of Carol’s friends.  Marie statedthat she’d “had problems” with her in the past, and that the calls were all made to Carol.  Marie angrilyaccused her of trying to start a lesbian affair with her daughter.  The detectives stopped returning her calls."
11/11/1977,44,"Carol’s car was stolen from the parking lot of the Oxford Mall.  It was found 2 hours later, abandoned andin flames.  Marie collected an insurance claim on the car."
"",44,"Moved again, to a house on Orchard Street.  The stated reasoning was that the house had a fenced yard forCarol’s dog.  However, Freeda Adcock suspected that Marie had done it to avoid creditors."
05/22/1978,44,"Carol had driven her mother’s car to school, and someone smashed the windshield while she was in class."
06/1978,,"The day after Carol graduated from high school, she and Marie moved in with Michael and Teri inPompano Beach, Florida.  They stayed for fewer than two months then moved back to Anniston.According to Michael, Marie was having “great financial difficulty.”  He also reported that she had anunhealthy fixation with his son Joshua, who was less than a month old.  He lived in fear that Marie wouldsteal him and disappear."
"",,"Moved in with (and probably poisoned) Carrie Hilley, her mother-in-law.  Agreed to split the utility billswith Carrie, but when Carrie gave Marie her half, she kept the money.  When the overdue bills arrived,Marie hid them."
"",,"Marie insisted upon sleeping on the living room couch, even though a guest bedroom was available atCarrie’s house.  Kept a crowbar and a rope underneath the couch, and a loaded .38-caliber revolver on themantelpiece.  While Marie was out, Carrie would often hide the revolver, but it always ended up back onthe mantelpiece."
"",,"Often disappeared after dinner, to return late at night with rolls of $100 bills; as many as $800 to $1,200worth.  Told her family that she got it from typing jobs, but they suspected that she was gambling.  Carriefeared Marie to the extent that she could no longer sleep at night."
07/27/1978,45,"Purchased a $25,000 life insurance on Carol, and listed herself as the sole beneficiary."
04/1979,45,Began poisoning Carol on the night of her senior prom.
05/06/1979,45,"Wracked by violent nausea, Carol had to be taken to the emergency room.  She was kept at the hospital forthree days, but doctors could reach no conclusive diagnosis."
05/08/1979,45,"Carol returned from the hospital only to become violently ill again the next morning.  Doctors still couldfind no physical cause, and suspected that the illness was psychosomatic.  According to Dr. WilliamWallace, Marie showed nothing but complete concern for her daughter, and expressed a desire tocooperate in any way she could do find out what was wrong with her."
"",45,"Poisoned nearly everything she brought Carol at the hospital.  Carol’s weight dropped from 107 lbs. to 87lbs."
"",45,"Told Carol that she had discovered money from Frank’s stock investments.  Promised her $10,000 to buy acar.  However, whenever Carol tried to go get the car, Marie gave her another dose of arsenic so that shewas forced to return to the hospital.  There was no stock, and no money with which to buy a car."
05/1979,45,"Depressed and frightened, Carol engaged in a half-hearted suicide attempt by overdosing on extra-strengthTylenol tablets.  Marie used the incident to quietly reinforce the idea that Carol’s illness was all in hermind."
"",,"Insured the furniture in Carrie’s house for $3,000.  Later that month, a fire started in Marie’s sleeping bag,"
06/01/1979,45,which had been left atop the washing machine near a leaky gas-powered water heater.  Marie had removed
"",,the batteries from the smoke detector a few days before.
"",,"Shortly after the fire, Michael visited her.  He challenged her about her finances.  She insisted that Frank"
"",,"had left her stock in the company he used to work for, but for whatever reason she couldn’t collect on it."
"",,
"",,They made plans to go to the bank right after breakfast to get everything sorted out.  Marie poisoned
"",,Michael’s breakfast so that he would be too sick to go anywhere.
"",,Attempted to frame one of her former employers for extortion.
"",,"Carol decided, over Marie’s objections, to rent her own apartment.  Once she had moved in, Marie"
"",,"appeared to relent and bought over $2,000 worth of furniture for the apartment.  She began to insist upon"
"",,
"",,spending the night with Carol.  Carol caught her disconnecting her telephone.  Carol suspected that she
"",,was trying to avoid creditors.  They had begun to call Carol in their efforts to find Marie.
"",,The manager of the store where Marie had purchased the furniture contacted Michael and told him that
"",,"Marie’s check had bounced.  That same month, Marie sold a car she had purchased in Michael’s name"
08/1979,46,
"",,"without first paying it off.  She began using Carol’s illness to solicit money from friends, relatives, co-"
"",,"workers, and employers."
"",,"In addition to putting arsenic in her food, Marie injected Carol with arsenic under the guise of giving her"
"",46,"anti-nausea medication.  A few days later, Carol’s toes went numb and she was having trouble climbing"
"",,stairs.  Carol was admitted to the Regional Medical Center four times that summer.
"",,"On Dr. John Elmore’s advice, Marie placed Carol in the psychiatric ward of Carraway Methodist Medical"
08/1979,46,Center in Birmingham.  By this point the arsenic was attacking the nerves in Carol’s hands and feet.  By
"",,"the time she was admitted to Carraway, she could no longer stand or walk."
"",46,Marie told friends and relatives that Carol had leukemia.  Wouldn’t let anyone visit her.
"",,Began administering Carol injections in secret under the premise that they would help her walk again.
"",,"Despite her promise to keep them secret, Carol called her friend Eve Cole about them.  Concerned, Eve"
"",46,
"",,alerted the rest of Carol’s family.  When it came to the attention of the doctors at Carraway that Marie was
"",,"giving Carol unauthorized shots, they forbade her from visiting."
"",,Dr. Elmore told Marie that he suspected Carol’s symptoms might be the result of heavy metal poisoning.
"",,"Marie abruptly checked Carol out of Carraway later that same day, against the advice of the doctors.  Her"
09/18/1979,46,
"",,"stated reasons for doing so were that Carol wasn’t improving, and that she felt the nurses hadn’t been"
"",,sufficiently careful with her.
"",,"Told Carol that they would go back to Anniston, over her protests that they didn’t have a car.  Insisted that"
"",46,"she had in fact bought a car, and that the seller would pick them up.  The next morning, Marie fell"
"",,violently ill with the same symptoms as Carol and Frank.
"",,"Went to University Hospital under the pretense of needing help for her nausea, but admitted Carol instead."
"",,"After Dr. Michael Thompson called Dr. Elmore, he looked for signs of poisoning in Carol.  He found"
"",,"Aldridge-Mee’s lines under her fingernails, signs of arsenic accumulation.  Her hair was found to contain"
09/19/1979,46,
"",,"one hundred times more arsenic than found in normal human hair.  While this was going on, Marie was"
"",,"arrested in the waiting room for passing worthless checks totaling $6,502.98.  The hospital never advised"
"",,the police about the poisoning.
"",,"Tests for arsenic poisoning in Carol Hilley test positive. Shortly after, Frank Hilley’s body was exhumed"
"",,and tested. He also tested positive for arsenic poisoning. Police also discovered that there were significant
1979,46,
"",,"amounts, though not fatal amounts, of arsenic in the bloodstreams of Lucille Frazier and Carrie Hilley at"
"",,the time they died.
"",,Marie was indicted at Calhoun County Jail for the murder of her husband Frank and for two bad checks
10/25/1979,46,
"",,"(equal to more than $6000). She was also charged with the attempted murder of her daughter, Carol Hilley."
"",,"Marie made bond and fled the state of Alabama from the hotel in Birmingham, Alabama that she had been"
11/18/1979,46,
"",,staying in.
"",,"Marie’s car is found in Marietta, Georgia with no sign of her. The FBI continues her search. It is"
1979,46,
"",,speculated that the car was left at a bus stop by a black male.
"",,Met John Greenleaf Homan III at a bar in Florida. Hilley told Homan that her name was Robbi Hannon

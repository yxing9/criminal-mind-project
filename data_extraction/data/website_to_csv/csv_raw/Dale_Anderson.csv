"Anderson was born in Canton, Ohio, to George “Dick” and Vera Anderson.  His"
11-24-51 0
father worked on a dairy farm and later became a minor.
"1952 1 The Family moved to Galesburg, Illinois"
"1952 1 A few weeks after moving to Galesburg, the family moved to Belleville, Missouri."
Anderson was a quiet baby. His first sentence didn’t come until he was almost
three years old. He spoke when his grandmother tried to discipline him.
1953 2
"“If you don’t stop that I’ll spank you,” she said"
"“I’ll spank you right back,” the toddler replied."
Anderson attended Galesburg High School and Graduated from Belleville West
High School. A loner who didn’t date he was an almost invisible student. More
1965-1969 14-18
than twenty people who attended his high school were unable to recall who he
was.
11-24-72 21 Anderson turned 21-years of age.
"Anderson began his college career at Illinois State University in Normal, IL. He"
1969-1974 18-21 majored in history and minored in sociology. He wanted to be a school teacher and
regularly made the dean’s list.
"One evening in the summer, Vera Anderson was standing in the kitchen of her"
"Belleville home, putting her financial records back in a neat file where she kept"
them. Her son just arrived home from the coal mines. He was angry.
"“I just bet you spent all my money,” Anderson said"
1972 20 His mother said it wasn’t true. Something in her son’s look alarmed her.
He suddenly grabbed her by the throat. He stopped chocking her when the
"telephone rang. His mother, hysterical, her neck red from her songs fingers, ran to"
a neighbor’s house. Dale Anderson had just revealed a sinister new personality
trait with shocking clarity. There would be other explosive outbursts.
During Anderson’s last two college summer breaks; he worked side by side with
1971-1973 20-22 his father in Peabody coal mine. His parents believe it was time for their son to
"learn to make his own way, so they had him save some of his pay for college."
"1973 22 Anderson married and moved back to Belleville, where his wife was reared."
"1977 26 Anderson’s first child, a baby girl was born"
Anderson applied for a job with the Illinois State police department. He was
1977 26 crushed when he was rejected. He had spoken often of his desire to become a
police officer.
1977,26,"He got a job at an Allstate insurance agency as a claim adjuster. Allstateeventually fired him for falsifying his records."
1977,26,"Family and friends noticed that he was becoming increasingly secretive. He beganto deadbolt the doors."
1978,27,"He worked for another insurance agency. Again he was fired, this time for askingfemale workers and clients out on dates. Confronted with the allegations,Anderson became enraged. He began screaming at his supervisor. .Police had toremove him from the building."
1978,27,"After being fired from his last job, he had fallen into the habit of telling people hewas an undercover police operative."
1978,27,"The family attended the Union United Methodist Church in Belleville, whereAnderson’s behavior attracted attention. He and his wife attended Sunday schooltogether. Soon, the men made it a practice to sit next to Anderson to prevent himfrom “Putting his hands on” other women."
1978,27,"Anderson finally got a job in police work. He became a sheriff’s deputy at the St.Clair County Jail in Belleville. Jailhouse deputies weren’t allowed to carryweapons, but that didn’t stop Anderson from buying guns."
1979,28,"Anderson had been hired as a jail guard under a federal program. When the one-year program expired, he was dismissed."
1980,29,Anderson became a case worker with the Illinois Department of Public Aid
1980-1987,29-36,"He told his family and friends that he worked for the Illinois Bureau ofInvestigation, but when in fact he did not work for them. He was still over at thePublic aid office."
"October1987",36,"Anderson was promoted; his new duties included determining who would receivepublic aid and the amount of their insurance."
1987,36,"With-in a month of his promotion his evaluation pointed to numerous problems.•Clients complained he didn’t return their calls•Consistent break taking•Cancelled cases with out their knowledge"
1987,36,"Anderson’s supervisor gave him an unsatisfactory work performance and cut hispay."
1987,36,"A week after the work hearing, Anderson took a sick day, that day, a dog ownedby on of the supervisors, was poisoned."
1987...,36,"Over the next several months, Anderson began advising public-aid recipients tofalsify their applications to get more welfare money than they were entitled toreceive. Those clients later had to pay it back."
"mid-May1988",37,"Anderson was caught rifling though his supervisor's desk. He took severaldocuments. Becoming increasingly belligerent, he was sent home. The supervisorsbecame suspicious that Anderson was taking case files home against policy."
05-23-88,37,"After another problem with Anderson, one of his supervisors asked to see him.Anderson refused."
05-26-88,37,"Anderson went to the Belleville Police Department, claiming his supervisors hadshoved him and taken $ 800 from his briefcase. He later signed a criminalcomplaint against them."
06-02-88,37,"Anderson called the Belleville News-Democrat and told a reporter about thecharges against the supervisors. He didn't identify himself and claimed he was anemployee in the public-aid office."
06-04-88,37,The story ran two days later.
06-07-88,37,"Anderson again called police, claiming that his supervisor had shoved him."
06-09-88,37,"Anderson went to a small town south of Belleville and fired several rounds ofammunition. He told a friend from church, a police officer, that his public-aidsupervisors had taken shots at him. He said they were trying to kill him."
06-10-88,37,Anderson was barred from the public-aid office.
06-11-88,37,"Audrey Cardenas joined the News-Democrat as an intern. A recent graduate ofTexas A&M, she was an eager, willing learner."
06-19-1988,37,"Audrey Cardenas (WF, 24) killed. Anderson bought two identical briefcases."
06-20-88,37,Audrey Cardenas failed to report to work.
"",,Anderson bought two more briefcases. Those would later be found on his bedroom
06-20-88,37,"floor. Busch, the crime scene investigator who wrote about Anderson, called them"
"",,"""assassin kits."""
"",,"Two days after Cardenas' disappearance was reported to the police, Anderson tried"
06-23-88,37,to disguise his voice when he called the newspaper. He said that his supervisors
"",,"had kidnapped the young woman, and he gave their home addresses."
"",,Audrey Cardenas' body was found in a dry creek bed on the campus of Belleville
"",,"Township High School East. Police arrested a California transient, Rodney"
06-26-88,37,
"",,"Woidtke, who had wandered onto the high school athletic field 150 yards from"
"",,Cardenas' body.
"",,Anderson attended Cardenas' memorial service at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in
06-28-88,37,Belleville. He stood in the back of the chapel with the police officers who were
"",,investigating the case
"",,"He went to a 36-year-old Belleville woman's house, flashed a badge and went in."
July 1988,37,He said he was an investigator working on the Cardenas murder. The woman
"",,became nervous and called police.
"",,Anderson was charged with disorderly conduct and impersonating a police officer.
"",,"During a court hearing on the charges, Anderson fainted. When he was arrested,"
07-13-88,37,
"",,"he had a briefcase containing a gun, a police light, a knife and several papers about"
"",,Cardenas.
"",,"Anderson was arrested again, this time for telling Cardenas' father that he was a"
"",,"police investigator on the case. When he appeared in court, he told a police officer"
July 1988,37,
"",,"that if he had a gun, he'd use it on the officer. He was arrested again and charged"
"",,with assault.
"",,"After each arrest, Anderson was released. For a brief time, he was considered a"
July 1988...,37,"suspect in the Cardenas killing, but there was no follow-up from investigators"
"",,when he refused to take a lie-detector test.
"",,Anderson instructed a 14-year-old friend of his daughter to write a note stating
07-29-88,37,that she had seen Cardenas at Anderson's house and that Cardenas was frightened
"",,of Anderson's public-aid supervisors.
"",,Anderson continues to insist that Cardenas was at his house the day before she
July 1988...,37,disappeared and that she told him she was investigating the public-aid supervisors
"",,for corruption.
August,,The supervisors fired Anderson for insubordination and stealing records. During
"",37,
1988...,,"the months he was suspended, Anderson's wife still thought he was going to work."
"",,He was convicted of one misdemeanor count of disorderly conduct. In a
December,,
"",38,"psychological evaluation, Anderson was characterized as paranoid and obsessed"
1988,,
"",,with his administrators and the Cardenas killing.
"",,Anderson believed that he was the only person who could solve the Cardenas
December,,
"",38,"murder, the psychologist reported. This time, Anderson was briefly jailed and then"
1988,,
"",,released.
"",,"During the year after the Cardenas murder, Anderson fabricated an Illinois State"
"",,Police report stating that his three supervisors had killed Cardenas. He also wrote a
1989,38,
"",,"memo, purportedly written by one of his supervisors, stating that the supervisor"
"",,feared for her life.
"",,Anderson and his lawyer went to see then State's Attorney John Baricevic. He
04-29-89,38,
"",,"gave Baricevic his ""documents."" Baricevic chose to discount them."
"",,"Without any physical evidence linking Woidtke to the crime, a judge convicted"
08-24-89,38,
"",,him of murdering Cardenas. Woidtke was to be sentenced on Sept. 28.
"",,Anderson posed as a home buyer from Springfield and entered a woman's home
"",,"near Belleville, which was for sale by a Realtor. The woman showed Anderson"
"",,around. He wore a baseball cap and carried a bag slung over his arm. He kept
09-20-89 38,,asking to look into a crawl space that led under the home. The woman opened the
"",,"cover and leaned in as Anderson stood over her. At that moment, a friend of the"
"",,woman walked into her kitchen. Anderson quickly left through the front door.
"",,"Anderson went to another woman's home. It was also for sale. Again, Anderson"
09-27-89 38,,
"",,wore a baseball cap and carried a bag. The woman wouldn't let him in.
"",,"Hours later, he went to the home of Jolaine Lanman in the Villa Madero"
"",,"subdivision, just east of Belleville. Prosecutors believe that Anderson posed as a"
"",,home buyer. The Lanman home was for sale. Jolaine Lanman let Anderson in.
"",,"Police believe that Anderson went through the house and, while looking at the"
"",,"bedroom of Lanman's 3-year-son, pulled something out of the bag and struck"
"",,"Jolaine Lanman in the head. He forced Lanman with a garrote, to write a note"
09-27-89 38,,
"",,saying that Anderson's three supervisors hit her and bragged about killing
"",,Cardenas. The note also gave the supervisors' license plate numbers. When the
"",,"husband arrived home soon after Anderson had left, John Lanman found his wife"
"",,and son underneath his bed. A rope was found around Jolaine's neck; pair of
"",,scissors was stuck in her throat. The back of his wife' and son's heads were
"",,crushed.
"",,"For the next two days, as police zeroed in on Anderson, officials feared for the"
"Sept. 28-29,",,
38,,lives of his family. Police went to other family members and asked them to try
1989,,
"",,phoning the Anderson home. No one answered.
"",,Police forced their way into the home. They took the children out of the home in
"",,"their night clothes. After talking with police for several minutes, Anderson crept"
"",,"out of the bedroom, cowering behind his wife. In the house, police found many"
09-29-89 38,,
"",,"weapons and hundreds of newspaper articles, notes and documents about the"
"",,Cardenas murder and Anderson's former public-aid administrators. Anderson was
"",,charged with murdering the Lanmans.
"",,Anderson was convicted of two counts of first degree murder for killing the
04-17-90 39,,Lanmans. He was spared the death penalty and sentenced to life in prison without
"",,parole.
"",,"Robert K. Ressler, perhaps the world’s most foremost expert on serial killers. He"
"",,believes that Anderson is responsible for the killing of the following people:
"",,
"",,"• Elizabeth K. West, a 14-year old freshman at the Belleville Township"
"",,"High school, who was found dead on May 5, 1978."
"",,
"",,"• Ruth Ann Jany, 21-year old girl whose body was found in July 1979."

"","Parents divorced.  He was forced to live with his mother in Lawrence,"
"",Massachusetts.  He was not allowed to visit his father and grew to hate his
1969,6 controlling mother.  He also had a babysitter who he fantasized about murdering
"",and cannibalizing.  He thought that the babysitter and his mother were planning to
"",break up his family.
"",Moved out of his house into a rundown apartment with his mother.  At this time he
"",was an outcast at school.  He was skinny and teased a lot by his peers.  This is when
1971,8
"",he decided to join cub scouts.  Around this time is when he began wondering what
"",it would feel like to kill someone.
1974,"11 He moved to Portland, Maine."
"",He admitted that he was a homosexual.  This devastated him at school because he
1975,12
"",was teased and made fun of a lot.
"","He stabbed a 9-year-old girl, Sarah Canty, in the back with a pencil.  This was the"
"","first of a few attacks.  After he got away with that, he slashed another girl with a"
"",razor blade while riding by on his bicycle.  A few years later he attacked an 8-year-
1976 - 1979,13-16
"","old boy, and nearly strangled him to death.  After that he began using a knife to"
"","slash or stab people, but never killed anyone.  His offences were gradually"
"",increasing and he never got caught for any of these.
"","He attacked a 27-year-old student going to the University of Maine, John stabbed"
01-24-1980,17
"",her in the stomach and critically injured her.

"","He murders Richard Stetson (WM, 11) in Portland, Maine.  This was the first of his"
08-22-1982,19
"",three murders.  He stabbed the boy in the chest and was bitten by John in his calf.
"","He joined the Air Force.  He met a good friend, Eric Braden, who was his first"
1982,20 really close friend.  Something that he had never had before but had always wanted.
"",This deterred him away from killing for a while.
1983,"20 He loses his best friend, Eric Braden.  This made him fall into a deep depression."
"","He kills Danny Joe Eberle (WM, 13) in Bellevue, Nebraska.  He tied the boy up"
09-18-1983,"20 and stabbed him.  For this murder he used rope, tape, and a knife.  These were the 3"
"",main items he ever used.
12-02-1983,"20 He kills Chris Waldren (WM, 12) in the woods near the track in Papillon,"
"",,"Nebraska..  He took off his clothes, started to choke him and eventually stabbedhim several times in the back."
01-11-1984,20,"He attacked a woman at Aldersgate church.  She got his license plate and the policewere able to locate him.  Police arrested him at his apartment on the Air Force base.They brought him to the police department and he eventually confessed to themurders of Chris Waldren and Danny Joe Eberle."
07-03-1984,21,"In Nebraska, pleads guilty to the murders of Chris Waldren and Danny Joe Eberle."
10-09-1984,22,The judge sentences John Joubert to die in the electric chair in Nebraska.

10-15-1990,28,"He was convicted in Maine of the murder of Richard Stetson, his first victim."
1990,28,He spent his time drawing on tissue paper his fantasies of violence with boys.
1995,32,"He appealed his death sentence in a Nebraska court and the court reviewed the case.He argued the fact that the court’s wording of the aggravating factors wasunconstitutionally vague.  The court upheld his sentence."

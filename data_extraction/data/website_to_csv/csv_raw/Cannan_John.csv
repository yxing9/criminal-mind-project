02/24/1954,0 Born in Warwickshire (Sutton Coldfield) in England
"",Parents sent him to a private school for boys.  He had a teacher that always ate
1958,4 biscuits during break time.  Cannan bragged later in life about how he used his
"",charm to persuade her to allow him to have biscuits as well.
"",A teacher took him into a vacant classroom and instructed him to drop his trousers.
"",The teacher touched him between the legs and wanted John to touch him as well; he
1961/1962,7/8 did it in fear of the teacher.  He claims to have felt ashamed from it and that it went
"",on for months because he couldn’t tell anyone about it.  He became afraid of school
"",after this and developed a stammer from being nervous all the time at school.
"",He was taken to the family doctor because of this nervousness and then did not
"",return to the school.  He used the experience at school to explain why he was
1963,9 “different” from others and why he didn’t have any close friends; claimed he
"",always had to deal with humiliation and shame which led him to express anger and
"",resentment.
"",He gained 5 certificates of secondary education and 3 ordinary level general
"",certificates of education; because of his athletic ability he was offered the chance to
1971,17 train with the Birch Harriers which was a leading athletic club but his father was
"",against the idea.  Left school and joined Merchant Navy; it was thought he joined to
"",escape his family but was only a part of the Navy for 3 months.
"",Married June Vale; his one and only steady girlfriend and the engagement lasted 7
"",years; he claims he was hassled into marrying her; his mother-in-law was
May 1978,24
"","pressuring them to start a family.  June then turned up pregnant, he thinks it was on"
"","purpose, they had a daughter named Louise."
"",He was smoking and drinking heavily at this point instead of going home after
"",
"",work to be with his family he would frequent the bars and night clubs.  He was
1982,26
"",practically an alcoholic at this age.
02/14/1980,"26 Meets Sharon Major, 32.  She lied about being married and so did he."
"",John and Sharon began living together with her children.  They took family trips
April 1980,26
"",and he even met her family.
Early,"John became upset when Sharon’s ex was coming to spend Christmas with the kids,"
"December,",26 he got jealous but Sharon wasn’t going to prevent the kids from seeing their father
1980,on Christmas.
12/31/1980,26 They didn’t see each other after this argument until December 30th when he showed
"",,up at her house with a bottle of wine and suggested they talk things out.  Sharon
"",,claims that during intercourse he put his hands around her neck so that she could
"",,"barely breathe.  She claims he told her he was going to kill her, he even brought a"
"",,gun but it turned out to be an air gun. She pushed him down the stairs to try to get
"",,away from this now-violent man.  After falling down the stairs he snapped back to
"",,his old self and began to apologize after he saw her bleeding and realized it was
"",,because of him.  On the way to the hospital he told her again that he had meant to
"",,kill her.
"",,"John meets Jean Bradford, 37, who ran a ladies knitwear shop.  He enters the shop."
"",,Jean was the only one there with her 17-month-old son.  He held a handkerchief to
"",,"his face appearing to have a runny nose.  John then pulled a knife on her, threatened"
"",,"to hurt her son, and used very vulgar language while threatening them; asked for all"
03/06/1981,27,
"",,the money she had.  Her mother comes into the store; he rapes Jean in front of her
"",,mother and son.  Jean’s husband comes to the front door of the store & John tries to
"",,escape out the back when he arrives at the store.  They report the attack to the
"",,police immediately after this.
"",,John was questioned about the attacks on Sharon Major.
03/14/1981,27,
"",,
"",,John received a jail sentence of 8 years-5 years for the rape and 3 years for stealing
06/26/1981,27,money and stealing a car (which he took after quitting at the car dealership).
"",,
February,,
"",28,"John was transferred to Horfield prison, Bristol."
1982,,
"",,"John was moved to The Verne, a semi-open prison at Portland, Dorset.  His father"
September,,
"",30,"came to visit him 2 days after he arrived there, it was the last time he saw his father"
1984,,
"",,who was terminally ill with cancer at the time of his visit.
"",,John’s father passed away but they had exchanged attempts to make peace with
February,,
"",31,each other when he visited John in prison.
1985,,
"",,
"",,John was sent to Wormwood Scrubs prison in a pre-release scheme; this lasted for 6
01/25/1986,31,
"",,months and provided him some freedom although he was still in custody.
"",,"Sandra Court was strangled to death.  She was last seen in Lansdowne, near"
"",,Bournemouth around 3 a.m. John was also in Bournemouth on this night.  A letter
"",,"was sent to the police after the discovery of the body, the handwriting appeared to"
05/03/1986,32,be disguised as someone left handed who was writing with their right hand (John
"",,was left handed).  John was questioned about this murder.  John still claims to not
"",,know this woman and there was no concrete evidence tying him to this crime so he
"",,"was not charged with the crime, only questioned about it."
07/25/1986,32,John released from prison.
"",,"A woman, Suzy Lamplugh, disappears from west London, John was later suspected"
"",,of this crime.  She was a 25 year old real estate agent.  She was scheduled to meet
"",,“Mr. Kipper” to show him some property; she never returned to work that day.  Her
"",,"car, a white Ford Fiesta, was later found a mile from the street the property she was"
"",,"showing was located.  The car was badly parked, handbrake off, driver’s door"
07/28/1986,32,
"",,"unlocked, purse still in the car indicating she left in a hurry or was forced to leave."
"",,"Witnesses also recalled seeing a mid-1970s dark blue BMW, the type of car John"
"",,"drove, parked at the location of the property that day.  John conveniently doesn’t"
"",,recall what he was doing this day.  Nothing solidly links him to the crime other than
"",,hearsay.  He still denies having any involvement with this woman’s disappearance.
"",,"Meets up with Annabel, his solicitor that was working for a law firm in the city and"
"",,advised John about his rights to his daughter while he was in prison again for the
September,,
"",32,rape.  He claims they had chemistry from the moment they met.  They had
1986,,
"",,consensual sex after drinks.  Later that month John attempted suicide by taking 68
"",,paracetamol tablets.
10/06/1986,32,Donna Tucker got into a tiff with her husband; went for a drive to give him some
"",,"space, parked under a street lamp to read her book.  She saw a man walk back and"
"",,"forth past her car, eventually he stopped to ask for directions.  He asked for a map,"
"",,as she was looking for it the man opened the car door and held a knife to her.  He
"",,"raped her, also had anal sex with her.  She and her husband reported the incident to"
"",,police who began a search for the rapist.  John was suspected as the rapist.
"",,John was questioned about the rape of Donna Tucker; but throughout the interview
11/14/1986,32,
"",,denied everything and was not ever convicted for the crime due to lack of evidence.
11/30/1986,32,John moves back in with his mother in Sutton Coldfield.
"",,John meets Gilly Paige – 24 year old showgirl.  Gilly was on an iceskating tour
06/14/1987,33,which ended their relationship.  He was still with Annabel at the time he met Gilly.
"",,He threatened Gilly as well.
08/18/1987,33,His relationship with Annabel ended
09/11/1987,33,John meets Marija Vilcins
09/13/1987,33,"Takes Marija on a date & meets her mother, uses his charm on both of them."
"",,John signed up at a video-dating agency; gave a fake name of John Peterson;
End of,,
"",,"requested a girl between 25 and 35, with stunning good looks and be in great"
September,33,
"",,physical shape; owners of the agency felt there was something not quite right about
1987,,
"",,him so they didn’t even release his video to be viewed by other daters.
"",,"Julia Holman walks to her car alone, a man attempts to force himself into her car;"
10/07/1987,33,
"",,she was able to fight him off.  Police suspect John Cannan of being the attacker.
"",,"Shirley Banks, 38, tells her husband that after she is going to look for a new dress"
"",,and never returned.  Her husband started to get worried when she didn’t return.
10/08/1987,33,Shirley called in to work complaining that she was sick and wouldn’t be there;
"",,people in her office didn’t know she was not at home or else they would have held
"",,her on the line.
"",,John was arrested after entering Carmel Cleary’s store and pulling a knife on her
"",,and another woman.  He ran out of the store as another man entered to try to help
10/29/1987,33,the girls.  He was chased down the street and dropped some plastic bags along the
"",,way.  The police went through these and found the knife as well as a jacket with
"",,blood on it.
"",,John was charged with the abduction of Shirley Banks.  John was very
"",,uncooperative; and believed that the information he withheld is what put him in
10/30/1987,33,
"",,control.  He spent 17 days in police custody being questioned because of his
"",,stubbornness in answering the questions asked of him.
"",,At a police lineup Holman positively identified the attacker as John Cannan.  He
11/05/1987,33,
"",,was charged with attempted kidnap.
"",,Police decide not to formally charge him with kidnapping Shirley Banks after
11/09/1987,33,
"",,seeing the lack of evidence.
"",,John is questioned for the last time about Shirley; her thumbprint was found in his
"",,flat indicating that he was lying about not knowing her and their relationship was
12/22/1987,33,
"",,more than just an acquaintance because she had been to his flat; at 3:16 p.m. he was
"",,charged with the murder of Shirley Anne Banks.
"",,Basil & Jill Hooper and their family went on a walk on Easter Sunday and
"",,discovered a decomposed body; it appeared to be Shirley Anne Banks.  The body
04/03/1988,34,suffered severe head injuries which is what was believed to be the cause of death.

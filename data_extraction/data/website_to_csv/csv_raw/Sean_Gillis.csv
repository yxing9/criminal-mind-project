"06/24/1962 0 Born in Baton Rouge, LA"
"Sean’s father, Norman, held a gun to his head.  After that, his father left because he"
did not want to hurt Sean or his mother.  Sean’s father was in and out of different
1963 1
"mental institutions, but Sean and his mother, Yvonne, did not hear from Norman until"
Sean was 17.
"Sean’s mother, Yvonne, raised Sean.  She was very good to him and loved him very"
"Childhood much.  Even though his father was not in the picture, they visited Norman’s parents"
"very often, and he had a good relationship with them."
Sean and his mother moved to a new neighborhood in Baton Rouge when his mother
was able to afford it. One of the neighbors stated that Sean “gave the other kids in the
1971 10
"neighborhood the willies.” However, Yvonne described him as being normal and"
"liking things most young boys like, such as building model cars."
Yvonne said that Sean was normally very well-behaved.  She reported she only
Childhood spanked him once with a thin belt. She said she felt so bad after it that she never did it
"again.  If he ever misbehaved, she would just take away his TV privileges."
Sean attended Catholic schools because his mother wanted him to have that education.
"He met one of his best friends, John Green.  John Green described him very"
Childhood
"positively, saying that he was a very smart person, was respectful towards adults, and"
had a good sense of humor.
"When Sean entered 7th grade, he attended Redemptorist High School.  He also became"
"1974 12 best friends with John Rosas.  He, Sean, and John Green used to spend time going to"
"the movies, the mall, or just each other’s houses."
"As they got older, Sean and his friends got into some minor trouble now and then, but"
nothing too bad.  They went through a phase where they became interested in Devil
Worship.  They watched some people who were participating in the acts and enjoyed
Adolescence
"the thrill of being scared from it.  The boys also would smoke marijuana together, but"
Sean enjoyed it more than the others.  Sean kept this part of his life a secret from his
mom.
"A neighbor, Carolyn Clay, saw a different side of Sean than his mother did.  One"
Adolescence
"night, she reported that “about three in the morning, I awoke to a loud noise coming"
"",,from their yard. Sean was in the front yard beating wildly o some garbage cans. He
"",,told another neighbor that he was frustrated because he didn’t have a girlfriend. He
"",,"was prone to fits of anger like that. He was an angry young boy.” However, Sean’s"
"",,mom did not see this side of Sean.
"",,"Norman’s father, Sean’s grandfather, passed away.  This led to Sean seeing his father"
1979,17,for the first time since he left when Sean was 1 year old.  This eventually led to Sean
"",,and Norman developing a relationship.
1980,18,Arrested for the first time for criminal trespass.
"",,Sean graduates from Redemptorist High School.  Both his mother and father were
1980,18,
"",,there to see him graduate.
"",,Sean sees disturbing photos that belong to his Father’s.  They were of naked men in
"",,various sexual positions.  Sean found out that his father was homosexual and this
"",,"horrified Sean very much. Norman, who had previously had trouble with alcohol,"
1980,18,
"",,joined Alcoholics Anonymous.  Norman called Yvonne and Sean a few weeks later to
"",,"come visit him at his new home in California, but they refused to visit him.  Sean was"
"",,never able to deal with what he had seen.
"",,"Sean began working for Southland Corporation, which owned the 7-11 chain of"
"",,"convenience stores.  Over the next few years, Sean changed jobs often and was never"
1980-,18-20,
"",,"really content in one place.  Sean did not like to work, but instead enjoyed to sit in"
1982(?),(?),
"",,front of his new computer.  He attended a community college and eventually got
"",,certified in computers.
"",,"Sean lived with his mother over these years, until she got offered a job in Atlanta."
1982-1992,20-30,"She asked Sean to go with her, but he said no.  Sean was on his own for the first time,"
"",,but his mother still sent him money and helped him out.
"",,"After his mom leaves and he has more time to himself, Sean really begins to discover"
1992,30,
"",,how much he enjoyed pornography on the internet.
"",,"Sean was caught peeping into a neighbor’s window, which he claimed he was looking"
1992,30,for his cat.  The police were called and he was arrested because of outstanding
"",,warrants for traffic violations.  He was released shortly after.
"",,Sean met Terri Lemoine where she worked.  He asked her out shortly after.  They got
"",,into an argument after they had begun dating and Terri slapped him.  Sean did not hit
1994,31,
"",,"her back, but he began crying.  After that, Terri apologized and they promised there"
"",,would be no violence in their relationship.  They became very serious after this.
"",,"Sean killed his first victim, 81-year old Ann Bryan.  He tried to rape her, then he"
03/21/1994,31,
"",,stabbed her 47 times.
"",,"Terri found out that Sean drank a little too much, which really upset her.  She also"
1994,32,"found out that Sean’s mom spoiled him by sending him money.  Eventually, Terri was"
"",,able to get Sean a job where she worked at a convenience store.
"",,Sean and Terri move in together.  Terri had been upset with Sean because they had
"",,only had sex a couple times throughout their relationship.  After they moved in
1995,33,
"",,"together, Terri found out that he was addicted to pornography.  Eventually, even"
"",,"though it bothered her, she learned to ignore the issue."
"",,"Sean shows Terri a website of pictures of dead women.  Terri is disgusted, but Sean"
1995,33,
"",,"finds it funny.  Again, Terri doesn’t give the issue much thought."
"",,Sean is very sweet to Terri and treats her well throughout their relationship
"",,"Sean kills his second victim Katherine Hall (29), who is a prostitute.  He got her into"
"",,"his car by telling her he wanted oral sex. When she was in his car, he put a zip tie"
"",,"around her neck to kill her. She tried to get away, but Sean caught her and stabbed her"
01/04/1999,36,
"",,"16 times.  After she was dead, he undressed her and mutilated her body.  This would"
"",,become a common practice for Sean when he killed women. He took her body to
"",,another location and was found the next morning.
"",,"Sean kills his third victim, Hardee Moseley Schmidt (52). Unlike most of Sean’s other"
"",,"victims, Hardee was married, had three children, and was known in the community."
05/30/1999,36,
"",,Sean saw her running a few days before and knew she was his next victim.  When he
"",,"saw her running, he hit her with his car then got out and tied a zip tie around her neck."
"",,"He took her body to an isolated area, undressed her, and raped her. He kept the body"
"",,in the car until Terri commented on the smell the next day. He made up a story that he
"",,"hit a squirrel and later dumped the body at a rural parish, away from the Baton Rouge"
"",,area.
"",,"Sean kills his 4th victim Joyce Williams (36), another prostitute. He kills her with a zip"
"",,"tie like he does his other victims. This time, he takes her to his home to mutilate her"
"",,"body and cut off body parts. For the first time, Sean ate human skin from a victim. He"
11/12/1999,37,
"",,cut off Joyce’s nipples and ate them. Sean picked up Terri from work with the body in
"",,"the backseat of the car. Later that night, he dumped the body on the east side of"
"",,Iberville Parish. The bones of her body would not be found until January of 200.
"",,"Sean kills his 5th victim Lillian Robinson (52), another prostitute. He killed her in the"
"",,same way and also took her to his home. He did not have enough time to mutilate her
January,,
"",37,"because Terri was getting off work soon, but instead played with her dead body and"
2000,,
"",,put his penis into her mouth. He took her to a deserted place away from Baton Rouge
"",,and dumped her body in the Atchafalaya Basin.
March 2000,37,Lillian’s body was discovered by some fishermen.
October,,Sean goes to New Iberia to see his goddaughter Christine. He had always been good
"",38,
2000,,to Christine and loved her very much.
"",,"While visiting Christine, Sean sees his next victim. After he visits, he kills his 6th"
"",,"victim, Marilyn Nevils (38). She was a prostitute and was killed the same way. He"
October,,
"",38,"also took her dead body to his house and he showered with her corpse. Later, he took"
2000,,
"",,the body and left it on top of a levee without trying to hide it. The body would be
"",,found later by a man walking in the woods.
October,,
"",,Sean didn’t kill anyone for these years. There was another serial killer who went after
2000-,,
"",38-41,"prostitutes, Derek Todd Lee. Sean “admired” his work and kept newspaper clippings"
September,,
"",,of the stories on the people he killed.
2003,,
"",,"Sean killed his 7th victim, Johnnie Mae Williams (45). Unlike his other victims,"
"",,Johnnie had many people that were close to her and children. She had become a
"",,"prostitute, though. Sean picked her up because he knew her. She had cleaned his"
October,,
"",41,house a few times for money. Sean killed her in the same way as his other victims.
2003,,
"",,"For the first time, he took a body part (her hands) from one of his victims. Sean drove"
"",,to another place to leave her body and just left her body exposed on top of an
"",,embankment.
"",,"Sean kills his 8th and final victim, Donna Bennett Johnson (43). She, like Johnnie"
"",,"Mae, had children but had become addicted to drugs and became a prostitute. He"
02/26/2004,41,"killed her using a zip tie, like all of his other victims. He mutilated her body, and he"
"",,cut off her nipples and ate them. Sean took about 50 pictures of the victim. He took
"",,her to another location and posed her body.
"",,"A task force was formed to look into the deaths of Donna, Johnnie, and Katherine, as"
03/032004,41,
"",,well as other similar unsolved homicides.
"",,Sean is approached and questioned by Agent Jeff Methvin at his home. Sean agrees to

"",,4 years and that Sean had confessed to killing her. Lafayette PD had no report of her

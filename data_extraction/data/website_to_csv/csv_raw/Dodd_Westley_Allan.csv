"07/03/1961 0 Dodd was born in Toppenish, Washington and would be the oldest of three"
children
06/05/1962 11 Dodd’s brother was born and he began bathing and sleeping with him.  Dodd
months would continue to bathe with him until he was 7-years-old and sleeping with him in
the same bed until he was 10-years-old.  Dodd denies any sexual contact with his
brother.
05/29/1965 3 Dodd’s sister was born and the only memory he has of her being a baby was his
mom breastfeeding her.
"1966 4 Dodd stated that when he was in the hospital to have his tonsils removed, he was"
embarrassed after wetting his pants when his mom was getting him ready for
surgery.
"June, 1970 8 While at his 8-year-old cousin’s house, Dodd and his cousin sexually experimented"
by touching their penises together.
"September, 9 Dodd’s mom made him change his pants two times in front of two of his aunts and"
1970 he stated that he felt a lot of embarrassment from this event.
1971 10 Dodd was first rejected by a girl when he pulled down his pants in front of his 6-
year-old neighbor; she refused to look at him.  Dodd later stated in his letters to a
police official that he believes this is the moment he began preferring boys over
girls.
1972 11 Dodd began realizing that he had different interests from other children his age
when he began searching for pictures of nude beaches so he could see the naked
people on the beach.
"1973 12 While at school at Chief Joseph Jr. High, Dodd began getting picked on by his"
peers.  Dodd stated that the peers began realizing his interest in boys when a boy
had asked him to take a shower with him and then told the rest of his class about
Dodd wanting to take a shower with the child.
1973 12 Dodd’s friend described to him about how his step-dad had to use a catheter to
"urinate.  Later, Dodd would begin experimenting with his body and would put"
straight pins and the filler of ink pens into his penis.  Dodd said that he would trick
his victims by saying that he could do tricks “kind of like a sword swallower” to
"",,lure them to his house and then he would molest them.
May 1975,13,"Dodd started flashing young children (he said it was because he had started pubertyand was not educated about sex).  He started out by standing naked in his bedroomwindow while children passed by on their way to school, but soon learned that thiswould get him in trouble so he decided to take his “show on the road” by ridingaround the neighborhood flashing young boys.  He chose to flash boys because“boys didn’t report me as often as girls.”  During two months, he had exposedhimself to 40 children.  Dodd stated that his unhappiness stemmed from his parentsconstant bickering and their lack of emotional support."
July 1975,14,"The police came to Dodd’s house after a report of him exposing himself tochildren, but he was not punished.  Because of his fear of getting caught, Doddbegan masturbating on a daily basis and experimenting with his genitals.  He wouldput the band of his watch around his genitals, squeezing his testicles through andattach a cord to where the watch would have been.  He would then attach weightsto the cord to see how much weight his genitals could hold."
1975,14,"His Father, Jim Dodd, knew about Westley’s sexual deviance through father-sontalks, but avoided talking about it with him or authorities."
"Fall, 1975",14,Dodd experimented with his sister’s friend (age 10) sexually.
"Fall, 1975",14,"Dodd snuck into his sister’s bedroom while she was sleeping and placed her handon his penis.  He then pulled down her pants and was going to have sex with her,but she woke up and pushed him away.  Nothing was told about the event."
1975,14,"He began describing himself as socially isolated and intimidated by girls, which arethe first symptoms of pedophilia"
"November,1975",14,"Dodd played tug-of-war with his 8-year-old male cousin by tying a string to eachof their penises.  Afterwards, Dodd had anal sex with his cousin."
1975,14,"He molested his own 8-year-old cousin in a closet and her 6-year old brother laterthat day"
"December,1975-January,1976",14,"Dodd got a bicycle for Christmas and would begin flashing himself around town.He had at least 10 victims during this time."
"January1976",14,"Dodd began letting his dog lick his rear because he stated that he enjoyed it.  Inorder to get his dog to lick his penis, he would rub feces on it.  After the dog bithim, Dodd decided to wipe feces on his stomach, genitals, and thighs and thenwould masturbate before showering."
"May, 1976",14,His parents divorced
"August,1976",15,"Dodd got tired of exposing himself and stated that he needed physical contact.  Inorder to fulfill his wish for physical contact, he went to Sacajawea ElementarySchool and found 3 boys and 3 girls, ages 7-10, who were tricked into playing a“guessing game” with Dodd, in which he would put his penis in each of thechildren’s hands.  He later played this game with 3 more children."
"March 10,1977",15,"Dodd was arrested for exposing himself to two girls ages 8 and 10, but he was notprosecuted.  Instead the authorities recommended counseling.  Over the years,Dodd would occasionally attend counseling, but not much.  Dodd stated that hewas not afraid of the law because he had molested and exposed himself tonumerous children before being caught."
1977,16,"He was asked to fill in for a neighbor’s usual babysitter and molested their twosons ages 1 and 4 and their 3-year-old daughter as they slept"
"September,1977",16,"He began to masturbate in the Columbia High Auditorium, but he was nevercaught."
"October,1977",16,"Dodd went on his first date with a girl and he later stated that it was one of theworst evenings of his life.  He denies any sexual contact with the girl."

"July, 1979",18,"While at camp, he kissed his first girl.  He only kissed her once and avoided her therest of the summer because he felt that she was too experienced for him."
"August,1979",18,"Dodd encountered a young boy who was fishing alone in a wooded area.  He askedthe boy if he wanted to see something “really neat.”  Once they were alone, hedemanded that the boy undress, but they were interrupted by another group of kidsbefore Dodd was able to molest him."
"September,1979",18,"Dodd found an empty house in an isolated area one block from the SacagaweaElementary school.  He would take small boys to this house and play strip pokerwith them."
"November,1979",18,"Dodd realized that his only interest was boys and girls under the age of ten after agirl who was a year younger than him asked him out on a date and he refused to go."
"July, 1980",19,"Dodd went back to the Christian music camp and would shower with three of theboys in his cabin."
"October,1980",19,"Dodd attempted to abduct two girls-ages 11 and 7, but they reported him to thepolice.  He admitted to wanting to molest them and having a plan to take them toan isolated area at the river, but he was not incarcerated."
"September,1981",20,"He enlisted in the U.S. Navy.  Dodd stated that “if I hadn’t joined the Navy then Imay have been killing within a year”"
1981,20,"Because of his high entry test scores, he was put on submarine duty.  He went tobasic training in San Diego, California and graduated in the top 10% of his class."
1981,20,"While stationed at a submarine base in Bangor, Washington he preyed on childrenliving on the base."
1981,20,"While stationed in Banger, Dodd would take trips to Seattle where he would molestchildren in a bathroom at a movie theater."
1981,20,"Dodd began offering money to children in exchange for them to take their pantsdown."
1981,20,"He discovered that the arcade was a great place to find children who wanted moneyso he would give children quarters for his demands."
"May, 1982",20,"Dodd was arrested after offering to pay a few boys $50.00 each to go into a moteland play strip poker with him.  Dodd confessed to the police that he planned tomolest the children, but his chargers were dropped for unknown reasons."
12/30/1982,21,"He was arrested and discharged from the Navy for “attempting indecent liberties”on a boy.  Dodd served 17 days in jail and was ordered to get counseling."
May 1984,22,"He was arrested for molesting a 10-year-old boy.  Despite the fact that his initialsentence would have put him in jail, he was given a suspended one-year sentenceprovided that he attends counseling."
"August 1,1984-December,1984",23,"Dodd was convicted in Idaho for molesting a 13-year-old boy, but he only servedfour months out of his ten year sentence."

"August,1986",25,He engaged in sexual intercourse with an 18-month-old son of his coworker.
"August,",25,Dodd had his first sexual intercourse with his coworker (who’s son he was also
1986,,raping).  He stated that the only way he had an orgasm was to picture her son.
1986,25,"Dodd moved to Seattle, Washington.  Dodd stated that “now when I got to Seattle,I had learned I was less likely to be reported for molestation than for an attempt.  Idecided that from now on I would be a little more forceful.  I would no longeraccept no as an answer to my requests.”"
"",25,"He began choosing the most vulnerable children, including a roommate’s 2-year-old son who was partially deaf and could not talk.  When the boy resisted, Doddtied his hands with a bathrobe strap."
"",25,"Dodd began to fantasize about killing his victims.  “The more I thought about it,the more exciting the idea of murder sounded.  I planned many ways to kill a boy.Then I started thinking of torture, castration, and even cannibalism.”"
1987,26,"Dodd chose the first child he would murder.  His first victim was to be an 8-year-old boy he met while working as a security guard for a construction site.  Whiletrying to trick the child to go home with him, the child stated that he was going togo get some of his toys and he ended up telling his mom about Dodd and the policewere called.  Dodd was arrested, but his sentence was reduced to a “grossmisdemeanor” and he spent 118 days in jail, with one year probation"

"September1989",28,"Dodd was working as a shipping clerk at Pac Paper where he told his coworkersthat he was divorced and his child recently died of “crib death”."
"",28,"Dodd discovered David Douglas Park, located a mile from his new apartment,where he decided was a “good place for a rape and murder, or kidnap...a goodhunting ground.”"
09/02/1989,28,"On Labor Day weekend, he noticed three boys at the park and they sparked violentfantasies."
09/03/1989,28,"Dodd wrote in his diary that “if I can get it home, I’ll have more time for varioustypes of rape, rather than just one quickie before murder.”  Like most sociopaths,he depersonalized his target victims."
09/04/1989,28,"He packed a fish fillet knife bandaged to his ankle, and shoestrings to tie up hisvictims.  He waited at the park, but he did not see any children without parents sohe decided to return home till the evening."
09/04/1989,28,"He returned to the park and paced restlessly up the path.  After pacing, Doddencountered two young boys; Billy Neer (WF, 10) and Cole Neer (WM, 10). Doddtold them to get off their bikes, “I want you to come with me.” They did what hesaid and went with Dodd.  Dodd stabbed Billy in the stomach and then attackedCole as he jumped up catching him in the side with his knife.  Billy tried to runaway but Dodd caught and stabbed him in the shoulder."
09/04/1989,28,"The police came right before Billy died, but he didn’t live long enough to tell themwhat had happened."

"LateOctober1989",28,"Dodd plotted his next attack.  He decided that Saturday afternoons, after work, wasthe best time to find a boy."
10/29/1989,28,"Lee Iseli (WM, 4), was picked up by Dodd at the Richmond School Playground.Lee’s father had let him and his older brother go to the park and play alone.  Doddtook Lee back to his apartment in Vancouver."

"October1989",28,"Dodd dumped Lee’s body at the Pac Paper Plant and discarded Lee in the bush nearVancouver Lake.  He burned the child’s clothing, all except for his Ghostbustersunderwear – which he stashed away in his brief case under his bed."
11/01/1989,28,In the morning of this day a pheasant hunter discovered Lee’s body at Vancouver

"",,Lake.,
11/01/1989,28,"Dr. Ronald Turco prepared a psychological profile of the killer—he would be 25-35 years old, and “kicked out of the military if he served.”  He would be a loner,and probably kept photos of his victims, a diary of his offenses, including clippedarticles, and child pornography.  The killer probably chose boys because he sawgirls as “defective.”  Although this profile accurately described Dodd, it wasn’tenough to conjure up a definitive suspect.",
1989,28,"Composite sketches were released, and hundreds of calls came in from people whothought they had seen Lee with someone, but there were no solid leads.Investigators attended Lee’s funeral hoping to spot the killer, but Dodd stayedaway.  He sat in his room, alone with the diary, and built a “torture rack” out ofboards and ropes, intended for his next victim.",
1989,28,"Dodd decided his best chance now to find a child would be at the movies.   Hechecked the listings for family features. “After a few attempts, there was success –but this time Dodd would be the capture.”",
"November,1989",28,"William Graves allows for the capture of Dodd.  Dodd was questioned andeventually confessed to the murders of Billy and Cole Neer and Lee Iseli.  Themost incriminating piece of evidence was his briefcase found under his bed.",
"",28,"Dodd was charged with first-degree murder of Billy and Cole Neer and Lee Iseli.Dodd was also charged with attempted kidnapping at the New Liberty Theater.Dodd pleas not guilty.",
"January,1990",28,Dodd changes his plea to guilty on all counts against his attorney’s wishes.,
1990,28,"Dodd read a statement to the judge that indicted him on all charges and admitted allhis crimes were premeditated.  His defense did not call any witnesses nor did theypresent any evidence.  His attorney did try to argue that he was insane because nosane person would write an account such as Dodd did.",
07/15/1990,29,"Jury gives Dodd the death penalty.  After being sentenced, Dodd asked to be hungbecause he believed it was the most appropriate execution since he stated:  “that’sthe way Lee Iseli died.” The judge agreed and set the execution date for January 5,1993.",
"January 5,1993 at12:05 AM",32,"Westley Allan Dodd is executed by hanging.  He becomes the first to die in thegallows since 1965.",

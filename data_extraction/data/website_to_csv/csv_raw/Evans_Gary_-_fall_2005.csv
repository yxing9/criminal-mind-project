Her new boyfriend was African American.  Gary did not likethat at all and told her it was over.  He demanded that she give him backeverything he had ever given her or else he would have to hurt her.  Shenever saw this side of Gary until then.

He committed burglaries with Michael and usedtheir apartment for stolen items and for planning the future burglaries."
Spring 1980,25,"Gary was caught with a couple hundred dollars in stolen items and wassent back to jail because he was still out on parole for not serving theremaining 2 years of his sentence.  He was brought to Old RensselaerCounty Jail in downtown Troy, New York.

"December 12, 1982",27,"A few months before Gary was going to be let out on parole, the NewYork State Department of Corrections transferred him.  He was movedabout 400 miles west to Attica State Prison.  It is known for having theworst criminals.  He was not allowed in the general population of theprison.

Spring 1983,28,Gary was back in crime with his old business partners Michael Falco and
"",,Tim Rysedorph.
"April 22, 1983",28,Gary was caught again on Easter day.  This time he was burglarizing a
"",,home.
"May 10, 1983",28,He was picked again while he was out on bond.  The crimes he committed
"",,this time were grand larceny and burglary.  He was taken to Saratoga
"",,County Jail.

"March 31, 1984",29,"Evans was set free, but was put on a “conditional release program”.  This"
"",,meant he had to be on his best behavior until the remainder of his sentence
"",,(9 months) was over.  He committed burglaries as soon as he got out of
"",,"jail, but he was never caught.  He was living with Tim Rysedorph and"
"",,Michael Falco.
"September 16, 1984",29,This was Gary’s release date and he was sat free from parole.
"January 10, 1985",30,Gary’s conditional release expired.  Since Tim was not committing that
"",,"many burglaries with Gary and Michael, Michael became Gary’s main"
"",,partner.
"February 16, 1985",30,"Falco and Evans go to East Greenbush, New York in Falco’s brown"
"",,"Plymouth satellite.  They bring along 2 large duffle bags, a police scanner,"
"",,"a rope ladder, and some common burglary tools.  Their goal was to get"
"",,some gold and valuables.  They hopped on top of a portable toilet and got
"",,up on the roof.  They then entered through the using the hatch to the roof.
"",,They filled the two duffle bags with jewelry and valuables wroth about
"",,"$15,000.  When they got in the car and drove for a minute, a cop pulled"
"",,them over.  The cop asked them what they were doing behind the building
"",,and they said they had to go to the bathroom.  The cop wrote down their
"",,names and addresses and let them go.
"April 21, 1985",30,He acted like he was going to do a drug deal with two guys.  When the
"",,"guys went in his trunk to get a large quantity of marijuana, Gary took off"
"",,"on foot.  Gary had taken $12,000 from the guys.  Gary later came back to"
"",,the same parking lot where they had met and stole the car the two guys
"",,had came in.  The two guys then went to the police and said Gary Evans
"",,"robbed them of $12,000 at gun point and then stole their car.  He traveled"
"",,"from Troy to Cohoes, New York.  As Evans pulled into town, he ran a red"
"",,light.  A cop saw him and turned on his lights to pull him over.  Evans
"",,"thought he was being pulled over for the burglary and took off, throwing"
"",,the gun and his fake identification out of the vehicle.  Evans finally gave
"",,up.  Police later retrieved the gun and the fake identification.
"April 22, 1985",30,Gary moved from the Cohoes County Jail to the Albany County Jail where
"",,Jim Horton (an investigator) could talk to him.  Evans confessed to Horton
"",,that he and Falco had been tipped off about how to get into the building by
"",,the father of someone they knew.  He then had to sign a statement.  He
"",,"was waiting for sentencing of charges of criminal possession of a weapon,"
"",,"first degree armed robbery, and grand larceny and burglary of a jewelry"
"",,"store.  Horton notices that a Cohoes Police Officer stole $3,000 of the"
"",,"$12,000 that Evans had stolen from the two drug dealers.  Evans remained"
"",,in county jail until his sentencing.
July 1985,30,Evans was sentenced to another 2 to 4 year period in early July.  He was
"",,moved to Clinton Correctional Facility.  He was also moved to Renssaler
"",,County Jail in July of 1985 and was soon released.
July 1985,30,Killed  Michael Falco age 30.  Evans uses a .22-caliber pistol with a
"",,homemade silencer made of door screen and duct tape to shoot Michael
"",,"Falco in the back of the head.It happened in Gary, Michael, and Tim’s"
"",,apartment in New York.  Tim Rysedorph was upstairs in their apartment at
"",,the time.  Evans put the body in the trunk of Tim’s car.  Evans then got
"",,Tim to help him wrap the body in a sleeping bag.  They then drove all the
"",,"way to Lake Worth, Florida (in Palm Beach County) where Gary’s sister"
"",,Robbie lived.  They buried Falco near his Robbie’s house and stayed in
"",,Florida for about 6 weeks.  They then went back to New York.  The reason
"",,Evans shot Falco was because Tim Rysedorph told him that Michael Falco
"",,"had stolen a piece of stolen jewelry from him.  In reality, Rysedorph has"
"",,stolen the necklace and given it to a lady the three men knew well.  After
"",,"Evans had killed Falco, he found out Tim had lied when he saw a lady he"
"",,knew wearing the necklace.  The lady said Timmy had given it to her.
August 1985,30,Evans was arrested and moved to Sing Sing Correctional Facility in
"",,"Westchester County, New York in late August.  At this time, Evans started"
"",,writing letters to Jim Horton.  He told on people in the letters.  Evans also
"",,mentioned he heard someone had seen Falco at a concert.  Horton was not
"",,yet aware Evans was a murderer.
December 1985,31,Gary Evans was transferred to Dannemora prison again.  Around this same
"",,"time, Robbie wrote Gary.  Robbie would seldom write Gary in prison.  She"
"",,wrote that someone had called her and disguised themselves as Gary.  She
"",,said it sounded just like him.  The person said something about having a
"",,fetish with animals and then bragged about having sex with animals.  It
"",,"angered Gary, but he dropped the subject quickly."
March 1986,31,Gary wrote to Robbie that he had a visit from one of the Harrington twins.
"",,The twins were Steve and Bob.  Steve is the twin that came to visit him.
"",,Steve and Gary were “business acquaintances” according to Gary.  In
"",,"addition, they had known each other for a long time, but it was not a"
"",,"friendship.  Around this same time in jail, he started fantasizing about his"
"",,ex-girl friend and her family he had not seen in close to 15 years.  He
"",,"planned on finding her and killing anyone who got in his way, including"
"",,her current husband.
December 1986,32,Gary was moved to Clinton Correctional Facility.  He was placed under
"",,protective custody by his counselor because he believed some of the Hells
"",,Angels were still after him.  He wrote to Horton complaining that the
"",,police were holding him a little over 2 years (when his sentence had a
"",,maximum of 4 years).  His release date was suppose to be in December of
"",,"1987, but he was informed it would not be until March of 1988.  Evans"
"",,wrote a letter to Horton and asked him to contact Torri Ellis (Falco’s
"",,common-law wife) to see if she has heard anything about Michael Falco.
1987,32,Gary befriends David “the Son of Sam” Berkowitz.  Berkowitz was known
"",,"for killing young, innocent girls.  David would often refer to Gary as “the"
"",,Great Tricep King”.  Berkowitz angered Gary because he sent him a
"",,fitness magazine with an African American in an article.  Berkowitz
"",,apologized and said he forgot how prejudice Gary was.  When they were
"",,lifting one day Berkowitz got mad at Gary because Gary called him
"",,“David Berserk-o-witz”.
December 1987,33,Gary went into a child molester’s cell and “body slammed him all over”.
"",,He was then placed in solitary confinement for 15 days.  His punishment
"",,was considered to be lenient.
"March 1, 1988",33,"Gary was paroled and let out of jail.  This time, he had worked out and"
"",,"built a lot of muscle.  When he got out, he became friends with Damien"
"",,Cuomo and started committing numerous burglaries with him.  Around
"",,this same time he worked for a nursery and a local depot.  While working
"",,"at these places, he was still committing burglaries on the side.  During this"
"",,"time, he was committing more crimes than he ever had before."
March 1989,34,Evans and Cuomo were pulled over and were asked to step out of the
"",,vehicle.  The trunk was searched and the cops found all of the items they
"",,"needed to commit a burglary and/or a kidnapping including 3 ski masks, 2"
"",,"stun guns, a police scanner, 2 walkie talkies, a slim jim, crowbar,"
"",,"screwdrivers, duct tape, rope, 2 sets of handcuffs, gloves, hats, several"
"",,"maps of the Northeast, and a book on police radio frequencies.  The cops"
"",,did not do a thorough enough job because there was stolen merchandise in
"",,the door panels and under a carpet in the trunk.  The two men were booked
"",,at the Albany Thruway State Police barracks.  Evans and Cuomo would
"",,often wear shoes that were 3 or 4 sizes too big when committing the
"",,crimes in order to throw off police.
"September 8, 1989",34,Killed Douglas J. Berry age 63.  Douglas Berry was a store owner.  Berry
"",,was asleep in his store after hours.  Damien Cuomo and Evans robbed him
"",,"and in the middle of the robbery, Berry woke up.  Evans shot him once in"
"",,the head with a .22-caliber Ruger with a silencer on it.  Evans leaves a gun
"",,shell on the floor.  His body was left at the scene and was not hidden.
"",,"Evans kept an eye on the news in Watertown, New York about Douglas"
"",,"Berry’s murder.  A guy was arrested for it, but was soon released because"
"",,there was not enough evidence.
"December 26, 1989",35,"Killed Damien Cuomo age 28.  With Damien Cuomo, he shot him 3 times"
"",,in the back of the head after handcuffing his hands behind his back.  This
"",,shooting was also done with the .22 caliber.  He then wrapped him up with
"",,"a shower curtain, a blanket, and rope.  Damien Cuomo’s body was left at"
"",,the scene and hidden in a hole 3 feet around Evans had dug a few weeks
"",,before.  The hole had a wooden makeshift door on it.  He covered Damien
"",,with top soil.  He then covered the door with top soil and some brush.  He
"",,decided to kill Cuomo because he supposedly ripped Evans off on the
"",,"Watertown job.  Evans only got about $15,000 for the Watertown job."
"",,Evans believed he should have received more money out of the stolen
"",,"merchandise.  Soon after killing Damien Cuomo, Gary went to Florida"
"",,with his girlfriend at that time (she lived just down the street from Lisa and
"",,Damien).  He brought her so it would not be so apparent he was hiding
"",,something.
Summer 1990,35,"Evans goes to California to see Stacy, a former ex-girl friend he was"
"",,obsessed with.  He had not seen her for about 15 years.  He planned to take
"",,her away from her husband and make her love him.  He said that if he had
"",,"to he would kill her husband.  When Evans gets to California, he shows up"
"",,at her work and later has an argument with her husband.  She makes it
"",,clear that she does not want to have anything to do with him.  He gets the
"",,point she wants nothing to do with him and then goes back to New York.
"October 17, 1991",37,"Killed Gregory Jouben, a jewelry shop owner, age 36.  Evans shoots him 3"
"",,times in the back of the head with a .22-caliber pistol while he was looking
"",,"at a piece of jewelry.  For this murder, he put a pillow case around his gun"
"",,"to catch the shells, but he forgot he had left other things behind where he"
"",,had been staking him out in empty office buildings above his store.  Evans
"",,stole over $60.000 from Jouben after he shot him.
"October 18, 1991",37,Gary left for Colorado the day after killing Gregory Jouben.
"October 20, 1991",37,He returns only 2 days later from Colorado and goes to Latham.  He puts
"",,the gun that he killed Jouben with and another gun he had was carrying in
"",,a metal box.  He buries the box in the back of Albany Rural Cemetery in
"",,Menands.  He also steals a marble bench from the cemetery that weighed
"",,about one thousand pounds and brought it straight to New York and sold
"",,it.
March of 1993,38,"An antique shop owner, Kathy Alexander, found that several of her"
"",,"expensive items were missing including priceless diamonds, some gold,"
"",,and a rare handbag from a special collection.  It estimated to be around $
"",,"20,000.00.  Gary broke in through the bathroom window.  The woman"
"",,"found out 2 years later that it was Gary Evans, but she never suspected it"
"",,was him.
"January 10, 1994",39,Evans had been arrested for stealing a marble bench from a cemetery.
"",,Evans was placed in a cell next to Jeffery Williams in the Albany County
"",,Jail.  Wingate and Horton placed Evans beside Williams to see if Evans
"",,could get and information out of Williams.
"February 12, 1994",39,Evans was released from Albany County Jail.
"March 20, 1994",39,"Evans went into the Norman Williams Public Library in Woodstock,"
"",,Vermont when it was closed and stole the Birds of America book by James
"",,Audubon.  A federal judge was on the Board of Trustees for the library.
Middle of June 1994,39,Evans met with Horton and Wingate.  Evans turned himself in for stealing
"",,the Birds of America book.  Horton talked to the federal judge after the
"",,FBI tried to get the book back from Evans.  Horton was able to bring the
"",,judge down to 27 months instead of 25 to life for Evans.  Evans agreed to
"",,return the book for the lesser sentence.
"June 9, 1995",40,Evans was formally sentenced to 27 months for stealing the book.  He
"",,waited about a year just to get the sentence.  He was being held in federal
"",,prison in Vermont.
"June 6, 1996",41,He was released from prison.
"October 3, 1997",42,Killed Tim Rysedorph age 39.  He shot Rysedorph 3 times in the back of
"",,the head with a .22-caliber handgun.  Rysedorph had been helping Evans
"",,clean out their storage room at Spare Room II Storage Facility of their
"",,stolen items.  He then cut his body up with a chainsaw and bagged his
"",,body up in 5 pieces.  Each part was bagged and tapped and then placed
"",,into a cardboard box.  He rationalized his acts because he had to transport
"",,"the body to the burial site on a steep hill in Brunswick, New York."
"",,Rysedorph was buried in a shallow grave.  He tosses the gun on his way
"",,out of the storage facility.  He tossed it over a fence and in a ditch that runs
"",,along the interstate.  Evans said he tossed the chain saw into the Hudson
"",,"River, but it was never found.  After the murder, Evans jumps probation."
"",,Nobody was able to track him down for about 7 months.  The police
"",,"finally tracked him down and he was arrested in Jonesbury, Vermont"
"October 4, 1997",42,Evans calls Lisa Morris and asks where Tim Rysedorph is and she says
"",,she does not know.  He says his name is Lou.  She asks who he is and he
"",,says he is a friend from work and he is returning a call from Tim.  He
"",,"suggests that maybe Tim is in trouble, since Lisa has not heard from him."
"October 5, 1997",42,Evans calls Lisa Morris using his alias Lou again.  He says that Tim might
"",,be gone like Mike.  He was referring to Michael Falco.
"May 27, 1998",43,"Evans was captured without incident in Jonesbury, Vermont.  He also"
"",,confesses to killing 5 people.
"June 3, 1998",43,He was moved from Vermont jail to Albany County jail as a federal
"",,prisoner.  He spent most of his time in Albany in protective lockdown.
"June 19, 1998",43,He admitted to killing Tim Rysedorph.  Evans was taken to Brunswick so
"",,he could show where he had buried the body in two shallow graves.
"June 24, 1998",43,He admitted to the killings of two jewelry shop owners.  They were
"",,"Douglas Berry and Gregory Jouben.  Later that day, he admitted to killing"
"",,Damien Cuomo.  Evans later lead investigators to where he had buried
"",,Cuomo in the woods.  The body was in a shallow grave with top soil on
"",,top of it.  Jim Horton makes Evans call Lisa Morris.  Horton wanted Evans
"",,to tell her that he had killed her boyfriend (Cuomo) and tell her he was
"",,sorry for leading her on all of those years.  Evans had led Lisa to believe

"",,"Cuomo was still alive and had just left her and his daughter behind.  Evansalso admitted to killing Michael Falco on this day and told Horton he wasburied near his sister’s house in Lake Worth, Florida.  He was nottransported to Florida to show them where he placed the body because hewas considered to be too high of an escape risk.",
"June 29, 1998",43,"He was transported from Albany County Jail in Colonie to the RensselaerCounty Jail in downtown Troy.  They transported him to a different jailbecause the jail was under construction and people noticed he was glaringat certain sections.  They were concerned that he might have been lookingfor a way out.",
"July 14, 1998",43,"Troop G released a report saying they had found and positively identifiedMichael Cuomo’s body in Florida.  Dental records were used to identifythe body.",
August 1998,43,Evans admits to Horton that he is planning an escape.,
"August 11, 1998",43,"He admits to Jo Rehm that he is going to escape.  He includes all of thedetails.",
"August 12, 1998",43,"Formerly charged with 8 counts of murder.  The DA’s office said that itwould decide over the next 120 days whether to try him as a capitaloffender and have him face death by lethal injection.",
"August 14, 1998",43,"Evans had a parole hearing in the morning at the Albany Jail in Colonie,New York.  He kicked out a passenger window of the Chevy van escortinghim to Renselaer County jail.  The van was on the Troy-Menands Bridgeover the Hudson River.  Four US Marshalls were surrounding him theentire time.  He ran to the center of the bridge, jumped, and dropped about62 feet.  He had two sets of handcuff keys; one set was from USMS andthe other set was from the Troy Police Department.  He had taken off hishandcuffs and his right hand was giving the bird.  He left a suicide letterthat included he would live the rest of his life in misery and would not getto share time with Doris Sheehan, the girl he loved.  He stated “I win”.  Healso left a note that he wanted to be released to television and thenewspapers.  Jim Horton also receives a letter saying “I win”.  An autopsyfound a razor blade and a paper clip taped to his ankle under his sock, ahandcuff key stuffed up his left nasal passage, and a razor blade stuffedvery deep inside his sinuses.  The authorities failed miserably when itcame to scanning Evans with metal detectors.",

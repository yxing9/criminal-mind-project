Summer of,,"the Kansas City area, where they promptly disappeared.  They vanished but their"

1994,,"mail, including their disability checks, was being forwarded to a mail box at the"
"",,"Mailroom. For years, the Social Security Administration continued to send checks"

February,,
"",56,typed letters from Suzette which that were allegedly written while she traveled
2000,,
"",,abroad but had Kansas City postmarks and were uncharacteristically mistake-free.
"",,Carolyn later testified that Suzette was a poor speller and never typed notes to
"",,friends or family.
"",,"The last time Carolyn Trouten heard from her daughter, Suzette. After contact with"
"",,"Suzette dropped off, Carolyn called the telephone numbers her daughter gave her"
"March 1,",,"and was surprised to have Robinson answer the phone. After all, the letters she"
"",56,
2000,,received from her daughter said they were traveling together. Robinson denied this
"",,and said she had run off with an acquaintance and stolen money from him. Carolyn
"",,contacted the Lenexa police and filed a missing persons report.
"",,"Robinson sent money to Vickie, a recently laid off psychologists from Texas who"
"",,was suffering from depression and lack of meaningful relationships. Police had
"",,tapped Robinson’s phone and were aware of his contacts with Vickie. When she
"",,"visited him over the Easter weekend, the police listened in the next room of a hotel"
"",,while Robinson and Vickie engaged in very rough sex. Robinson forced her into
Spring 2000,56,"sex acts Vickie did not want to do, took photos when she was tied up despite her"
"",,"explicit instructions not to, and slapped her much harder than she expected. These"
"",,"acts constituted sexual battery. In addition, Robinson left her without any money"
"",,"and alone in a strange city for several days before returning. When he came back,"
"",,"he ordered Vickie to return to Texas to await further instructions, but kept the $500"
"",,worth of S&M toys and props she brought with her.
"",,"Jeanna, an unemployed accountant also from Texas, came to Kansas City ready to"
"",,begin work as Robinson's executive assistant for his hydroponics business. He put
"",,"her up in the hotel where he had sodomized and robbed Vickie, and left her for"
"",,several days. When he returned he savagely beat her for not assuming a position
"",,naked in the corner when he entered the room. He then had sex with her. Jeanna
2000,56,"was not interested in extreme physical pain or photography, but he took his"
"",,liberties with her and then photographed the bruises on her body. Following the
"",,"same pattern as before, he gave Jeanna $100 and sent her home, ordering her to put"
"",,her possessions in storage and then return to Overland Park. She followed his
"",,"orders, but when she returned to Kansas, Robinson continued to play too rough and"
"",,"abandoned her in the motel. In fear, she contacted the police."
"",,Police arrested Robinson at his home. With them they brought search warrants for
"",,his mobile home and desolate ranch 30 miles away. At his ranch in La Cygne the
"",,"task force, with the help of a cadaver sniffing dog found the bodies of Suzette"
"June 2,",,

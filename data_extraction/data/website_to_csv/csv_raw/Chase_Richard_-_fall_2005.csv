Richard Trenton Chase
“Dracula Killer”
“The Vampire of Sacramento”
FBI agent Robert Ressler once asked Chase how he
selected his victims. He said that he went down the
streets testing doors to find one that was unlocked. “If
"the door was locked,” he said, “That means you’re not"
welcome” (www.nokilli.com).

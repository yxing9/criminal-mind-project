"1974 34 from a supermarket, put it down his pants and walked out, a store employee"
went outside to confront Bittaker and the employee was immediately stabbed.
Interviewed with forensic psychologist Dr. Ronald Markman; it was to be
1974 34
proven whether or not Bittaker was insane during the attempted murder. Dr.
"",,"Markman confirmed that Bittaker was a sociopath, and it was revealed that"
"",,Bittaker had faked all previous psychotic behavior.
1974,34,Was sent to California Men’s Colony at San Luis Obispo.
"",,Met Roy Norris at California Men’s Colony
"",,The two men claimed to be soul mates and never left one another’s side. They
1978,38,shared the same fantasies of domination through rape and torture. They made
"",,plans to have some “fun” after being released from prison. They planned to kill
"",,"young women ages 13-19, every year of being a teenager."
"",,Released from California Men’s Colony; moved in with his mother and
Nov 1978,38,
"",,purchased a silver 1977 GMS cargo van and named it “Murder Mack”
Feb 1979,39,Wrote to Norris and arranged to meet at a cheap downtown hotel
"",,The men searched for a place to kill the young women they planned on
Feb - June 1979,39,"kidnapping. The place was buried deep in the San Gabriel mountains, on a fire"
"",,mountain road;
"",,"Norris and Bittaker find their first victim, Cindy Schaeffer (WF, 16). She was"
"",,"taken by the men and brought into the truck, where Norris duct taped her"
06/24/1979,39,mouth shut and bound her ankles and wrists. She was driven to fire mountain
"",,"road where she was raped, and strangled with a wire hanger. Her body was"
"",,thrown in a canyon.
"",,"Norris and Bittaker picked-up Andrea Hall (WF, 18) who was hitch hiking the"
"",,Pacific Coast Highway. She was taped and bound in the back of the truck and
"",,"once again, brought back to fire mountain road. Andrea was repeatedly raped"
07/08/1979,39,by turns. Norris and Bittaker took pictures of the girl as she fought for her life.
"",,When she started to scream the men asked her not to stop. Bittaker stabbed
"",,"Andrea twice with an ice pick, once in each ear. She was then strangled and"
"",,then thrown off of a cliff
"",,Norris and Bittaker spotted their 3rd and 4th victims hitchhiking along the
"",,"Pacific Coast Highway. Leah Lamp (WF, 13) and Jackie Gilliam (WF, 15)."
"",,The men picked up the girls and said they were going to the beach; the girls
"",,smoked marijuana casually and noticed Bittaker drive away from the direction
"",,"of the beach. The girls tried to resist but were tied, bound, taken to the fire"
09/03/1979,39,"road, and kept prisoners for two days. Bittaker and Norris repeatedly raped and"
"",,tortured the girls while tape-recording the whole time. Norris took a baseball
"",,"bat to Leah’s skull. Bittaker stabbed Gilliam in both ears with an ice pick,"
"",,didn’t kill her so strangled her to death with a coat hanger. Bittaker squeezed
"",,Lamp’s throat while Norris pounded her head 7 times with a sledgehammer.
"",,The girls were then thrown off of a cliff
"",,While driving in the Sunland-Tujunga section of the San Fernando Valley the
"",,"men picked up hitchhiker Shirley Ledford (WF, 16). Almost immediately after"
"",,"entering the van, Shirley was bound and gagged with construction tape. The"
"",,"men repeatedly stabbed her with pliers; hit her with ice picks in the ears, and"
"",,hammers to the elbows 25 times while sodomizing her at the same time. They
10/31/1979,40,
"",,did not want her to stop screaming. The event was being recorded the whole
"",,time. The men eventually wrapped a hanger around Shirley’s neck tying it with
"",,"pliers until she died. The men then decided, instead of throwing her off of a"
"",,"cliff, to set her body on the front yard in a residential neighborhood, Hermosa"
"",,Beach.
"",,Burbank police in suspicion of rape and kidnapping arrested Bittaker at his
11/20/1979,40,
"",,home.
"",,Norris was brought before Detectives Cray and Bynum as well as District
"",,Attorney Kay and a judge. He was confronted about possible information
"",,"pertaining to the kidnapping, rape, torture and murder of several different"
11/30/1979,40,
"",,"women. He soon enough, confessed, and started to put blame on Bittaker. He"
"",,"was allowed to plea bargain, essentially putting more weight of the crimes on"
"",,"Bittaker. Norris and Bittaker were then charged with robbery, kidnapping,"
"",,"forcible rape, sex perversion, criminal conspiracy, and five counts of murder.Bittaker denied everything."
Feb 1980,40,"Bittaker was given a jury trial; the prosecutor was seeking the death penalty.During trial Bittaker showed no remorse for the killings. He also wrote a bookcalled The Last Ride which illustrated his partnership with Norris as well asdetails about their killing spree"
02/17/1981,40,"The Jury was finished deliberating the case, and brought 26 guilty verdicts forrape, torture, kidnapping, and murder. After these were heard, the case wasmoved on to a new phase, which would warrant the death penalty. 38 specialcircumstances were found;"
1981,40,"Bittaker was sentenced to death on March 24, 1981. The judge included anextra 199-year life sentence just in case his death sentence ever commuted tolife."
As of 2007,,Bittaker is still on death row at San Quentin Prison

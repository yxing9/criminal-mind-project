He was constantly taken to the doctor for diarrhea. Danny’s mother states that
“he never got over the diarrhea.” One night Danny was rushed to the doctor
because he refused to drink anything. He became so dehydrated that he was

old
At one week old Danny was left with a 12-year old girl named Andrea Herter.
"Gerry, Danny’s mother, said that Danny began to act differently after being left"
with Andrea. Gerry had neighbor’s coming to her home asking her what she was
doing to her baby because they could her Danny crying all day long. Gerry then
"began to notice things about Danny, he had developed severe diaper rash"
because the babysitter was not changing him and this caused him to cry all day.
Physical and sexual abuse was also a possibility during the times Danny was left
"",,"with the babysitter Andrea, and also her brother Fred. Danny was also left at"
"",,times with the maid Agnes.
"",,Danny fell out of a moving car. He tumbled head first onto the street. Danny’s
1962 or,,
"",2 or 3,father was driving and did not take Danny to the hospital. His father took him
1963,,
"",,home and sent him to bed.
"",,"Danny fell 9ft., head first, off of the slide while hanging upside down onto"
1965 or,,
"",5 or 6,asphalt. He was knocked unconscious and taken to the hospital. The examining
1966,,
"",,doctor said that there was no serious damage done.
"",,"Less than a year after the incident with the slide, Danny starts falling down a lot."
"",,"He collapses in the mall. Gerry things Danny is just trying to get attention, gets"
"",,"mad, and tells him to stop. Danny says that “he can’t help it.” First his head"
"",,"begins to hurt, then he gets dizzy and then his legs fall down. Danny was sent to"
"",,a series of doctors that found that his left foot was not growing at the same rate
1967,7,
"",,as his right foot. One leg was also shorter than the other which caused Danny to
"",,begin to favor one said of his body. A doctor in West Virginia told his mother
"",,that he thought Danny was suffering from a brain tumor. Upon examination it
"",,"was only found that Danny had Babinski reflex, this is where his toes curled the"
"",,wrong way then the doctor drew a stick across his foot bottom.
1967 or,,Danny’s mother noticed that Danny started to disappear into his room and was
"",7 or 8,
1968,,always “reading”
"",,When in first grade Danny’s mom got a call from his teacher saying that Danny
"",,could not be promoted to 2nd grade because he couldn’t read well enough. The
"",,teacher suggested Danny see a psychologist. The Psychologist concluded that
"",,"Danny was “a very, very bright boy” except ... and she then asked about"
"",,
"",,Danny’s stuttering. Gerrie said that she had noticed Danny’s stuttering at about
"",,age 3 or 4. The psychologist thought he could possibly be dyslexic and wanted
"",,him to wear a patch over one eye to correct the problem. That was the last time
"",,Danny saw a psychologist.
"",,Danny’s mother said that as a child he was very hyper. Danny’s teacher told his
"",,mother he was “hyperactive.” Danny’s mother did not know what that meant.
"",,Danny was unable to stay still. His mother could not get him to sleep at night or
"",,be quiet during the day. His problems at school were attributed to his boredom
"",,in class. He was thought to be to smart and not being challenged. His teacher
"",,said that he could do well if he would just apply himself and settle down.
"",,His mother tells of how he constantly aggravated his siblings. Constantly
"",,harassing them for attention and to annoy them. His mother said he was never
"",,"mean or violent, just trying to get them to play with him."
"",,From Danny’s journal: “I am extremely obsessive compulsive about order and
"",,"neatness. I would count things, jump over things mentally. In school he"
"",,describes being in a “hypnotic trance” being a “zombie.” He later depicts how
"",,these things continued into college. He would step over cracks which irritated
"",,him but he felt that he had to do it.
"",,"Danny’s mother talks about how she never had to discipline him as a child, he"
"",,"disciplined him self. Of her 4 children, Danny was the only one to keep his room"
"",,neat. She described Danny as having to have things more than neat. She recalls
"",,him being very upset if something was ever put out of order. She says Danny
"",,was the same way about his appearance; she described it as “immaculate.” She
"",,said Danny would take 4 or 5 showers a day.
"",,Danny’s mother said that he loved to draw. From Danny’s journal: Talks of
1967,7,
"",,being obsessed with drawing pictures depicting girls being trapped in devices
"",,From Danny’s journal: Tells of an over active sex drive/metabolism. Nothing
"",,was able to keep his attention. Now realize that hyperactivity may characterize
"",,his as “hyper.” He said that he always had a passion for danger. He
"",,"“loved/needed” to take risks. He enjoyed climbing trees, but not simply"
"",,"climbing, he would go as high as he could in the tree and then leaped from tree"
"",,to tree in “death defying” style.
"",,"He also plays childhood games with darts, bows and arrows and his bike."
1969 or,,
"",9 or 10,Started to become interested in girls
1070,,
"",,From Danny’s journal: Danny found a box of porn in an old abandoned house.
1970,10,Danny said that “I spent every free moment at that building looking at my secret
"",,treasures of magazines.”
"",,Danny’s father sprayed him with a water hose as a joke about Danny showering
1970 or,,
"",10 or 11,"so much. Danny got mad, packed a lunch and then headed off vowing to never"
1971,,
"",,come back. Danny only made it down the street.
"",,Danny’s mother says he discovered books at this time. Gerry said Danny would
1971 or,,
"",11 or 12,"almost read a book a day. He would spend weekends reading in his room,"
1972,,
"",,coming out only for meals.
"",,"Became depressed, started having obsessive habits, headaches, compulsive"
1981,,
"",,"following of girls, blacked out on several occasions."
"",,Danny says he was “addicted to adrenaline.” He hung his body out of a moving
"",college,
"",,vehicle at 70 miles per hours.
"",,"While at Georgia Tech, Danny took up sky-diving."
"",,Moved to California and bought his first motorcycle. Danny suffered his first
"",,"accident after only a few months, he slammed into the side of a car that pulled"
"",After,
"",,out in front of him. Danny only sustained bumps and bruises. Danny bought an

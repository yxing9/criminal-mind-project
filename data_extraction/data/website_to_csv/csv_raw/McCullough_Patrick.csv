"Born in Anchorage, Alaska to June (24) and Glen (27) McCullough. Born"
"two months premature, many issues at birth including being jaundiced,"
01/20/1960 0
"needing 3 blood transfusions, tachycardia (abnormal rapid heartbeats) and"
having a hernia repaired.
Was late in developing infant skills. Patrick sat up on his own at 9 months
1960 0 and walked at 18 months (average age for sitting up is 7 months and walking
is 1 year). Patrick was also hyperactive and had many tantrums.
07/1961 1 Family moves to Fort Meade (MD) for new military assignment
"Patrick was enrolled in Tinker Bell Nursery. This nursery, however, was not"
trained in dealing with deaf children and had a hard time communicating
with Patrick and dealing with his tantrums. They recommended that his
mother take him to a psychologist where the psychologist failed to realize
1961 1 1⁄2
that Patrick had a hearing disability and misdiagnosed him as mentally
"retarded.  He was put on many different medications such as Ritalin,"
"Luminal, Tegretal, and Dilantin to attempt to control his hyperactivity and"
"tantrums, all of which were ineffective."
"Patrick’s mother, June, was suspicious of Patrick’s ability to hear correctly."
1962 2
He was misdiagnosed with “hearing loss” and not as deaf.
Patrick was seen as a liability at Tinker Bell Nursery and was asked to leave
1963 3 permanently. His two older siblings began to resent him for the amount of
care and attention he needed.  Patrick’s father wanted to come home to
"",,obedient children and a tidy home. This couldn’t happen because of Patrick
"",,so Glen McCullough started spending more time away from the family. His
"",,family was instructed not to use sign language to communicate with Patrick
"",,and instead use the oral method in order to promote lip reading.
"",,"Father was assigned to work in Korea, leaving his mother to take care of all"
1964,4,
"",,the children alone.
"",,"The McCullough family was stationed in Fort Meade, Maryland. Patrick was"
"",,"now considered a ward of the state, considering his mother felt like she had"
"",,"no other choice, and was placed in Rosewood State Hospital in Owings"
"",,"Mills, Maryland. It was the Asylum and Training School for the feeble"
"",,minded of the State of Maryland. This put a rift in Patrick and his mother’s
"",,relationship which never seemed to recover. He was prescribed 10-
1965,5,milligrams of Mellaril three times a day.  He was entered into an eight-week
"",,summer school program at Rosewood when his behavior improved and
"",,during many parts of the class he would sit by himself with a book he could
"",,not yet read.  He was also doing therapy sessions with other patients in
"",,"which Patrick would make himself the center of attention, probably due to"
"",,the fact that he was not able to understand the conversation and got bored.
"",,He was now learning to use his charm and strength to get what he wanted.
"",,Patrick’s behavior improved and he was now able to be discharged from
"",,Rosewoods. Before he left he was fitted with a hearing aid that Patrick
"",,would often tend to “lose.”  Later tests showed that he really had no use for
"",,the hearing aid because his hearing was too impaired. Patrick was now
"",,enrolled in Oakland School where an oral-only method was still used and he
"",,was forbidden to use sign language. Patrick would also be sent away by his
June 1996,6,
"",,"parents when “speaking adults” would come over to the house, leaving"
"",,Patrick to feel dumb and embarrassed.  The school noticed pains in Patrick’s
"",,"head and stomach that lasted about a half hour, after which he became"
"",,"sleepy.  These symptoms pointed to possible epilepsy. Clinicians, however,"
"",,diagnosed that Patrick had no definite evidence of neurological impairment
"",,and was placed on Ritalin.
"",,"Mr. and Mrs. McCullough got divorced. Two months later, June remarries to"
03/28/1967,7,
"",,Carl Hilprecht.
"",,"Patrick is much more physically developed than others his age.  At age 10,"
"",,he weighed 82 lbs and was 5 feet 6 inches tall (average is 65 lbs and 4 feet
"",,10 inches tall). He seemed to enjoy sports because of his physique and he
1970,10,
"",,was good at them. Patrick was enrolled in Carver School where he was able
"",,to live at home and commute to school each day. He was able to use sign
"",,language to communicate in Carver.
"",,Patrick was assigned to the after-school outpatient mental health program at
1972,12,
"",,"St. Elizabeth’s Hospital in Washington, D.C."
"",,Patrick was asked to leave Carver School due to bad behavior.  He now
"",,"became an inpatient at St. Elizabeth’s Hospital and went to Deaf Unit, a"
1973,13,
"",,summer camp for deaf children. He was also asked to leave not only Deaf
"",,Unit but St. Elizabeth’s Hospital as a patient for attacking his psychologist.
1974,14,Patrick was now enrolled in the Maryland School for the Deaf (MSD)
"",,"in Frederick, Maryland. This seemed to be promising for Patrick unlike"
"",,the other facilities because MSD was one of the best programs for deaf
"",,children. Because of Patrick’s lack of education from not having the
"",,"proper techniques, he was behind academically and placed in classes"
"",,with younger students.  This was noticeable for Patrick as well as other
"",,"students, making Patrick feel dumb.  To overcome his setback, he"
"",,would use his sense of charm as well as his strength to win over
"",,"teachers, or scare other children into not messing with him."
"",,"Patrick would also use his strength in athletics at MSD, playing"
"",,"football, wrestling, and even running track. This gave Patrick"
"",,"something to be proud of.  He didn’t seem to have many friends, if any"
"",,"at all, due to his violent behavior. Other children would describe him"
"",,as “insane” and “a bomb”.  Patrick had many fights while at MSD with
"",,"students, both male and female, as well as faculty and coaches.  They"
"",,noticed that Patrick seemed to be almost blacked out when during his
"",,"fights, afterwards feeling extremely sorry and having little or no"
"",,memory of the attack.  They thought he might have a type of seizure
"",,disorder that caused this.
"",,Patrick was seen at the Frederick County Health Department Seizure
"",,Clinic where he was placed on the medication Mellaril which would
"",,hopefully stop the seizures and help control Patrick’s outbreaks. As his
"",,"violence continued, he was prescribed a greater amount of medication."
"",,"With his violent acts continuing, MSD decided Patrick was a liability"
"",,to students and staff. They would not let him attend school again until
"",,he could get his anger under proper control.
"",,The University of Maryland Hospital’s Neurological Unit tested
1975,15,Patrick and revealed no neurological symptoms.  He was then
"",,transferred to its Psychological Institute for inpatient treatment.
"",,While at the Psychological Institute he met a non-deaf girl who he took
"",,"an interest in. He became somewhat obsessive, attempting to sneak out"
"",,of the hospital to visit her.  She realized how violent he became and
"",,never spoke or saw Patrick again. This is the first we see of Patrick’s
"",,obsessive and violent relationships.
"",,"Not long after, Patrick was discharged from the hospital and was able"
"",,to go back to MSD where he showed improved behavior.
"",,The good behavior was short lived when Patrick was not in school.
"",,Over the summer he got into an altercation with his mother about his
"",,motorcycle. He destroyed the dining room and chased his mother with
"",,the leg of the table he had destroyed. Patrick calmed down for a little
"",,"while when a deaf neighbor interceded, speaking to him in sign"
05/26/1975,15,language. This lasted long enough for the police to arrive and arrest
"",,Patrick.  At this point Patrick’s mother believes that he is tearing the
"",,family apart and again asks the courts to declare him a ward of the
"",,"state. He was then taken to Crownsville Hospital Center, a hospital"
"",,focusing on the mentally ill.
"",,At Crownsville he expressed suicidal behavior such as cutting his
"",,wrist.
"",,Patrick was diagnosed with intermittent explosive disorder.  They
"",,"believed that this is common in patients with brain trauma, something"
1976,16,
"",,Patrick could have received due to the complications of Rh factor at
"",,birth.
"",,"Brent Toleman, a mental-health professional, goes to the Department"
"",,of Social Services so that Patrick could live with him as a foster son.
"",,He believed he could give Patrick the dedication it would take to turn
"",,his life around. He found that by having Patrick focus on working on
"",,"and driving a motorcycle, something Patrick had always been"
"",,"interested in, that it calmed him and made him more controllable.  This"
"",,also gave Patrick a sense of freedom he had not had before.
"",,Brent enrolled Patrick at Model Secondary School for the Deaf
1977,17,
"",,(MSSD). This did not last long considering he was having behavioral
"",,"problems again, and was also dismissed from MSSD."
"",,"Later that year, Brent attempted to reconnect Patrick with his family."
"",,Patrick was upset that they did not buy him any presents and upon
"",,"returning to Brent’s house, he got in a fight with Brent.  This resulted"
"",,in Social Services taking Patrick out of Brent’s custody and he was
"",,returned to Crownsville. He was assigned to the hospital’s maximum
"",,"security section, a unit for the criminally insane."
"",,"Upon turning 18 years old, he was discharged from Crownsville and"
"",,was no longer a ward of the state.  His discharge diagnosis goes as
"",,followed: “Deaf mute with Explosive Personality Disorder. Tested in
"",,the Superior Range (IQ=120-135) on the Wechsler Performance
"",,Scale.”
"",,"Brent, who was still part of Patrick’s life, urged local hospitals to work"
"",,"with Patrick, all of which denied. Brent then allowed Patrick to move"
"",,in with him to avoid homelessness and got Patrick a job at a
"",,"construction company. Instead of paying the rent he owed Brent,"
"",18-,
1978-1980,,Patrick went and bought a horse.
"",20,
"",,Patrick had many romantic relationships with hearing women.  He
"",,attracted hearing women because they would take pity on Patrick and
"",,"would want to help him.  In every relationship, Patrick would get"
"",,possessive and would want to spend every waking moment with his
"",,interest at the time.  When they would start to realize the intensity of
"",,"the situation they were in, they would start to back off, sending Patrick"
"",,into fits of rage. On one occasion Patrick had beat his girlfriend’s dog
"",,to death because she wanted to spend some time apart.
"",,Patrick moved to Annapolis with one of his girlfriends.
"",,Patrick got a job fixing boats at Yankee Yacht Carpentry Shop where
1979,19,
"",,"he moved in with his boss, Clint Riley."
November,,"For the first three months that Patrick worked for Riley, Riley would"
1979-,19-,"pay Patrick in full. But after three months, Riley began to only pay half"
February,20,of his wages and Riley would come back drunk at night. After around
1980,,"three months of this, Patrick demanded his pay. There were a couple"
"",,"minor fights between the two during this period of time. At one point,"
"",,Patrick took Riley’s dog and hid him thinking that he would use it for
"",,ransom to get his money. This failed to work and he ended up bringing
"",,the dog back.
"",,"There was a really bad fight where Riley took bullets out of his gun,"
02/02/1980,20,
"",,"point the gun at Patrick, and then pull the trigger."
"",,Riley took Patrick’s motorcycle and pushed it into the deep water. This
"",,escalated into an even bigger fight when Riley took a board and hit
"",,Patrick in the head with it. Riley pulled out a knife and Patrick pushed
02/06/1980,20,
"",,him into the wall until he dropped the knife. Patrick then saw Riley
"",,"was dead, cleaned the blood up that was in the shop, then put Riley’s"
"",,body in the back of a van and disposed of the body.
"",,Clint Riley goes missing after having an altercation with Patrick about
"",,money and rent. Police are keeping a close eye on Patrick. He began to
"",,have an alcohol and drug addiction and even resorted to burglary and
02/02/1980,20,theft to help fund his addictions.  He was arrested for such cases when
"",,"he was caught. During his court hearings, his victims or the judge"
"",,would take pity on him.  He would very rarely have any punishment
"",,for his behaviors.
04/16/1980,20,Trial begins
"",,Patrick was held at Anne Arundel County Detention Center while he
July 16-,,
"",,awaited trial and sentencing for when he jumped off the Eastport
October,20,
"",,Bridge after threatening the police with an axe. Most of this time was
"15, 1980",,
"",,spent in isolation due to his uncontrollable temper.
"",,"Got into a violent argument with Wendy Smith, his girlfriend at the"
"",,"time, in front of the restaurant where Smith worked. He hit Wendy and"
December,,"ripped her sweater, but he got off with no penalty when Smith dropped"
"",20,
1980,,her complaint and refused to testify. He was still found guilty of a
"",,"violation of his parole, so Patrick was sentenced to serving 60 days of"
"",,work release in the Anne Arundel County Detention Center.
"",,"After serving 60 days of work release, Patrick was arrested again for"
"",,"violating his parole, carrying a deadly weapon, disorderly conduct, and"
2/18/1981,21,
"",,breaking and entering with intent to commit a misdemeanor. No jail
"",,time was issued.
"",,"Patrick stole his friend’s motorcycle, and was again hardly punished."
"",,"He was given a two year suspended sentence, three years supervised"
06/31/1981,21,"probation, another six month suspended sentence, and two more years"
"",,"of probation. He would constantly ignore his probation requirements,"
"",,which in turn was upsetting public law enforcement.
"",,Patrick moved in with Rose Marie Harriman and her fiancé. She said
December,,he could live with her since she felt his strength would help protect her.
"",21,
1981,,She charged him $50 rent and said that he could fix things around the
"",,house in order to stay.
"",,"Parking attendant, John Myer’s, blood-stained body was found about"
02/17/1982,22,30 feet from where he collected money. Patrick would later be
"",,convicted of his murder.
"",,Patrick began working at the Noah Hillman Parking Garage to fill John
"",,Myer’s position. He already knew some of the parking garage staff
02/18/1982,22,
"",,since he would stop by there frequently while en route to the house he
"",,shared with Rose Marie Harriman and her fiancé.
"",,Patrick was viewed as the main suspect for John Myer’s murder
"",,especially because of the disappearance and the reappearance of the
"",,"pick axe handle that was used to kill Myer, after Patrick began working"
"",,there.
"",,"Patrick admitted that he killed and robbed Myers to a friend, Patrick"
February,,
"",22,"Lavoie, several days after the murder when he was confronted about"
1982,,
"",,how he got all the extra money to buy all these new things (leather
"",,"jacket, new pants, belt, Harley Davidson wallet, and parts for his"
"",,motorcycle). He admitted that he killed Myer by hitting him in the
"",,"head. Before this meeting, at a previous time, Patrick had confessed to"
"",,Lavoie that he “killed a guy in Eastport.”
"",,"Two months after being hired to work at the parking garage, he was"
April 1982,22,
"",,fired for sleeping on the job.
"",,"Patrick started a relationship with Marian Escalante, a 27-year old"
"",,nurse at a Washington D.C. hospital.
"",,"After Escalante had been confronted by Patrick’s parole officer, his"
"",,"foster father, Brent, and police about Patrick’s past and that he was"
September,,
"",22,"suspected of murdering Clint Riley and John Myer, she confronted him"
1982,,
"",,about the allegations. Patrick confessed to Clint Riley’s murder to her
"",,but claimed that it was self-defense. He showed her exactly what
"",,happened between him and Riley that day. He confessed to getting rid
"",,of the clothes and cleaning the shop before disposing of the body.
October,,A group of hunters found Clint Riley’s remains near Queenstown (30
"",22,
1982,,miles across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge from Annapolis)
"",,"After seven months of dating, Marian told Patrick that she wanted to"
"",,"take a break from the relationship. Several days later, she met him at a"
"",,"7-11 store, he got in her car, became angry, and ripped the mirror on"
"",,the passenger side of her car off and struck her with it. He then
"",,proceeded to try to break the passenger side window and he took the
"",,car’s radio antenna and twisted it into a knot. When Marian started to
April 1983,23,"roll up her window to keep him away from her, he punched her in the"
"",,"side of the head. Once she left, he followed her as she drove to Crofton"
"",,"towards the police station. At one point, pulling alongside her car,"
"",,grabbing and ripping off the driver’s side mirror. Instead of Marian
"",,"going into the police station and reporting all that just happened, she"
"",,talked to Patrick and told him that she forgave him but that their
"",,relationship was over.
"",,Detective G.L. Barr of the Annapolis Police Department and
"",,Investigator David Cordle of the State’s Attorney’s Office interviewed
June 1983,23,"Patrick about Myer’s murder. At first, Patrick changed his story"
"",,"multiple times but then denied going into the parking garage that night,"
"",,but admitted to seeing Myers around 2-2:30am but said that Myers was
"",,alive and he didn’t go over to talk to him.
"",,Patrick began to stalk Marian Escalante and destroying her property
"",,"(cutting the wires in her car so it wouldn’t start, etc.). She moved in"
"",,"with her parents and about a month later, after no sign of Patrick, he"
1983,23,
"",,showed up at her parents’ house. He got angry when she told him to
"",,leave and then began to hit her with his fists.
"",,He would continue to stalk and destroy her property.
"",,Patrick was in the Arundel County jail awaiting trial on the first and
"",,second degree murder charges for the murder of Clinton Riley. On the
"",,"third day of the trial, just before Marian Escalante was sworn in to"
02/16/1985,24,"testify, Patrick stood up and confessed. He pleaded guilty for “man"
"",,death” (manslaughter). Patrick claimed that it was self-defense.  After
"",,"Patrick’s confession, the prosecutor agreed to accept the manslaughter"
"",,plea that the defense lawyer gave.
"",,Patrick had his sentencing hearing. The only member of Patrick’s
"",,family that came to his sentencing hearing and his trial was his
"",,"grandmother, Goldie. The judge sentenced Patrick to the Anne Arundel"
"",,"Detention Center, where there would also be a therapist to provide"
5/14/1985,25,Patrick with psychotherapy. The judge reduced the sentence from the
"",,maximum of ten years to seven years. He also told Patrick’s lawyer
"",,that he hoped that Patrick would not have to serve the full seven years
"",,"and if Patrick cooperated under the program, he would modify the"
"",,sentence.
"",,Patrick was interviewed again regarding the murder of John Myer.
6/17/1985,24,"During this interrogation, the Detectives directly accused Patrick of"
"",,killing John Myer.
"",,Charged with the murder of John Myer. Patrick went on trial for the
"",,murder and robbery of John Myer. The Prosecutor ended up offering
"",,the Alford Plea agreement to the Defense due to worry about critical
"",,"evidence being admissible. Since Patrick accepted the Alford Plea,"
"",,"against his attorney, Paul Kirby’s, advice, his first degree murder"
"",,charge was reduced to manslaughter.
6/18/1985,24,The Judge gave Patrick a sentence of ten years to run concurrently with
"",,the seven year sentence received in the Riley murder case. The Judge
"",,"recommended that Patrick be placed at the Patuxent Institution, a"
"",,prison designed to treat mentally ill prisoners. But Patrick was placed
"",,"instead at a medium security prison, the Maryland Correctional"
"",,Institute at Jessup (MCIJ). He was not transported from Anne Arundel
"",,Detention Center to MCIJ immediately however.
9/10/1985,24,Grand jury indicts Patrick for the murder of John Myer.
"",,Patrick was transferred to the Maryland Correctional Institute at Jessup
1986,26,
"",,where he would spend the next seven years.
"",,Patrick spent his time at MCIJ watching TV and lifting weights.
"",,"Shortly after he arrived at MCIJ, he was placed in an academic"
1986-1993,,
"",,"program, pending good behavior. After spending about 5 months at"
"",,"MCIJ, Patrick was moved to Patuxent Institution. This institution did"
"",,not provide him with a sign language interpreter and Patrick was
"",,completely cut off from the outside world.
"",,"After seven months at the Patuxent Institution, Patrick requested to be"
"",,transferred back to MCIJ. His request for transfer was granted.
"",,"While at MCIJ, Patrick took a job as a welder. When some of his"
"",,"fellow inmates described Patrick in letters, he was described as a bully,"
"",,"insane, that he would get made when he didn’t get his way, and that he"
"",,would get into fights.
"",,Patrick wrote to his mother asking for forgiveness and if he could visit
"",,and see her when he got out. She responded that she forgave him and
"",,"he could call (using TDD, Telecommunications Device for the Deaf)"
"",,and write but he could not visit and that she never wanted to see him
"",,again for fear that he would get angry about something and harm her.
1992,32,"After serving seven years, Patrick was paroled from prison"
"",,Patrick is indicted for forging checks he had stolen to support his
8/10/1992,32,
"",,cocaine addiction.
February,,
"",,Sent to prison for forgery.
1993,,
"",,"Hollie S. Cutler, the public defender who represented him against the"
"",,"forgery charges, helped him get a job with a construction company, as"
1995,35,
"",,well as give him odd repair jobs around her home while letting him
"",,live with her briefly.
"",,He broke into Cutler’s home twice after she tried to end their
"",,"relationship. He burglarized her home, sliced up her clothing, and one"
10/16/1996,36,
"",,of the times left a lit candle in a possible attempt to set the house on
"",,fire.
"",,"While driving one day, Patrick pulled up behind Cutler and Detective"
"",,Neill Burke (now retired and working as a Private Investigator) at a red
"",,"light. When the light turned green, Patrick sped in front of them, did a"
"",,"180 degree turn, then came speeding back towards Cutler car. Cutler"
November,,"was able to steer away from a head-on collision, but not enough to"
"",36,
1996,,keep Patrick from side-swiping her car. Patrick proceeded to jump out
"",,of his truck and started charging toward Cutler until he saw Burke and
"",,saw that he was armed and Patrick fled from the scene. Patrick was
"",,"arrested and taken to jail. While he was awaiting trial, Patrick was able"
"",,to get out on bond but was ordered to stay away from Cutler.
"",,Receives suspended sentence for the burglary of Cutler’s house and
10/28/1997,37,was placed on probation. He is arrested later that day for violating the
"",,court order to stay away from Cutler.
"",,Sentenced to five years in prison for breaking his probation by stalking
"",,Cutler. He was placed at the Maryland Correctional Institute at Jessup.
11/17/1997,39,
"",,"He spent his time lifting weights, attending Bible study classes, and"
"",,writing letters to the court begging for a reduced sentence.
"",,Patrick was paroled from prison.
March,,
"",41,"After he was paroled, life was looking better. Two of his friends,"
2001,,
"",,"Gerald Martella and Pam Volm, hired him to work at Annapolis"
"",,"Carpentry Contractors, Incorporated. Patrick was able to rent his own"
"",,place in Grasonville. He was no longer using drugs or alcohol and he
"",,"didn’t drive his motorcycle anymore, opting for a pickup truck that his"
"",,employers helped him buy.
"",,"He was introduced to 48-year old, Randi Marie Eaton Lawrence by"
April 2001,41,Gerald Martella. They attended Alcoholic Anonymous meetings
"",,together.
"",,Patrick had begun to become clingy and possessive with Randi. Randi
"",,began to realize that she was losing her independence as well as being
September,,
"",41,deprived of any alone time with her family and friends so she told
2001,,
"",,Patrick that their relationship was over. Patrick began to call her even
"",,more and show up wherever she went.
11/27/2001,41,Randi wrote Patrick a five-page letter saying the relationship was over.
"",,At about 6:30 p.m. Patrick arrived at Randi’s house and shot her with a
"",,Berretta Model A-32 12-gauge shotgun that he had stolen from one of
"",,his employers. He first shot Randi through the sliding glass door while
"",,she was sitting at her kitchen table. This shot pierced her thigh. As she

11/30/2001,41,"Patrick then turned around, went into the kitchen, put the barrel of the"

Date Age Life Event

"Born in Webster, South Dakota.  He was the second son of Henry and Eileen and"
January
0 brother to Larry.  Jerry was an accidental birth and his parents preferred a daughter
"31, 1939"
"over a second son, despite the fact that they lived on a farm."
"At this time Jerry was living in Portland, Oregon and his family was financially"
stable. Jerry became fascinated with women’s high-heeled shoes.  He found a pair of
"1944 5 open-toed high-heeled shoes in a junkyard while wandering and playing alone, and"
wore them home.  His mother scolded him repeatedly for wearing the shoes and
eventually burned them.
"Family moves to Riverton, California and Jerry enters the first grade.  His teacher"
wears high-heeled shoes and keeps two pairs in the classroom.  Jerry hides the
1945-46 6-7 second pair of shoes from the teacher so that he can take them home.  A classmate
intercedes and Jerry confesses to his attempted theft.  His teacher gets angry and
Jerry becomes embarrassed and leaves the room.
"Jerry fails second grade.  He is diagnosed with the measles, sore throats, swollen"
glands and laryngitis during this time.  He had to get several operations on his
1946-47 7-8 extremities to fight against fungal infections. He also complained of frequent
headaches that often left him unable to see clearly.  School officials thought that
"eyeglasses might solve these problems, and also alleviate the problems he was"
"",,"having in school.  However, the optometrist did not find a significant need for"
"",,glasses.  A thin prescription was given to Jerry with the thought that they might
"",,"function similar to a drug placebo.  His headaches persisted, and eventual his IQ was"
"",,tested which came out to be within the normal range.
"",,"Jerry’s family moves twice more during this time to Grants Pass, Oregon and then to"
"",,"Wallace Pond, Oregon.  At Grants Pass Jerry’s neighbors had several teenage girls"
1947-1951,8-12,and Jerry began to sneak into the house with the girl’s brother and play with girls’
"",,clothes.  At this time Jerry’s shoe fetish expands to women’s undergarments.  At
"",,Wallace Pond Jerry’s father enters back into the agricultural industry.
"",,His brother Larry was now 16 and had a normal fascination with the nude female
"",,body.  Larry drew several pictures of nude females and kept them hidden in the fear
1952,13,that his disapproving mother would find them and become angry.  Jerry eventually
"",,found the box the drawings were hidden inside and picked the lock.  He was caught
"",,in the process and took the blame instead of telling on Larry.
"",,Jerry begins to go through puberty.  His mother again shows her disgust for anything
"",,"sexual in nature, even forcing Jerry to wash his stained sheets by hand.  Jerry begins"
"",,to have bizarre fantasies.  He fantasized that he would capture a girl force her to
1955,16,obey his commands and beg for mercy.  His family moves again to Corvallis Oregon
"",,were Larry is studying electronics at Oregon State University. Jerry continues his
"",,"habit of stealing women’s shoes and undergarments, and uses them to enhance the"
"",,pleasure of masturbation.
"",,Jerry steals the undergarments of an 18-year-old girl.  Jerry decides he wants to get a
"",,nude photograph of the girl instead of relying on the undergarments for his sexual
"",,pleasure.  He set up an elaborate plot to get the girl to pose for the nude photo.  Jerry
Late,,asked the girl to come to his house under the guise that he could help her get back
summer,16,her undergarments.  When the girl arrived she was accosted by a masked man with a
1955,,knife that forced her to remove her clothes and took several photos.  The man left
"",,and the girl got dressed and fled.  Before she could get away she ran into Jerry who
"",,said he saw the intruder and was locked in the barn.  The girl left and informed the
"",,police of what had happened.
"",,Jerry lured a 17-year-old girl to his car.  Jerry drove her to a deserted farmhouse
"",,where he beat her profusely.A couple stopped on the scene of the crime and
"",,notified the police.  Jerry claimed that he had stopped to help the girl himself and
1956,,"was not the attacker.  The couple did not believe Jerry, and eventually the Oregon"
"",,state police obtained a confession.  In Jerry’s house and car they found woman’s
"",,"undergarments, photos, photo equipment, and Jerry was arrested for assault and"
"",,battery.
1956,17,Jerry was committed to Oregon State Hospital for evaluation and treatment
"",,Initial diagnosis of “adjustment reaction of adolescence with sexual deviation and
04/16/1956,,
"",,fetishism”.
"",,While hospitalized Jerry was allowed to attend high school during the day at North
"",,Salem High School in Dallas Oregon.  Jerry is diagnosed as “borderline
1956,,"schizophrenic”, a diagnosis that was often given at this time.  Jerry remained"
"",,hospitalized for 8-9 months and was eventually discharged and deemed not to be a
"",,danger to society.
"",,Jerry was released from Oregon State Hospital and went back to high school in
1957,18,Corvallis.  He graduated high school with a low GPA in the lower 30% of his
"",,graduating class.
"",,Jerry tried his hand at college and advanced technology schools including Oregon
Fall 1957-,,
"",18-20,State university and Salem Technical Vocational School.  His attendance was erratic
1959,,
"",,and he eventual gave up on school.
"",,"Joined the U.S. Army.  Jerry was stationed at Fort Ord, California and did his basic"
03/09/1959,20,
"",,"training in Fort Gordon, Georgia.  He was granted the rank of E-2."
1959,20,Jerry began to have dreams that a Korean girl who would seduce him.
10/15/1959,20,"Jerry decided to go see the army chaplain who referred him to the army psychiatrist,"
"",,Captain Theodore J. Barry.  Barry discharged Jerry Brudos from the army because
"",,of his “bizarre obsessions”
"",,After being discharged from the armed forces Jerry moved back to Corvallis with
"",,"his parents, but was forced to live in their shed.  One night after running an errand,"
Late fall,,
"",21,he became excited by a young girl who was walking and followed her home.  He
1960,,
"",,strangled her until she was unconscious and then stole her shoes.  He slept with the
"",,shoes in an attempt to feel more powerful.
1960,21,Jerry obtained his FCC license and began working at the Corvallis radio station
"",,"While working at the radio station, Jerry meets his future wife, Darcie Metzler, who"
"",,was 17 at this time.  The two began going out and Darcie’s parents did not approve
January,,
"",22,"of this relationship.  Arguably as an act of rebellion, Darcie gave Jerry a kind of"
1962,,
"",,attention that he had not experienced before and the two were married within a few
"",,months time.
"",,Their daughter Megan is born. And the couple moves all up and down the west coast
1962,23,
"",,mostly because Jerry is not able to maintain employment.
"",,Jerry manages to get a job as a technician at a West Salem electronics firm.  He
1965,26,
"",,leaves the job after a while and the family continues moving around.
"",,The family settles in Portland where Jerry obtains a job as an electrician.  Darcie got
"",,"pregnant again, and Jerry was very excited to have a son.  However, Darcie would"
1967,28,
"",,not allow Jerry to be present during the birth of their son Jason.  Jerry is deeply
"",,saddened by this and regresses back to shoe and undergarment theft.
"",,Shortly after his rejection in the birthing room Jerry claims he stalked a woman in
"",,Portland. He waited for her to fall asleep at home.  He broke into the house and
1967,28,
"",,attempted to steal the woman’s shoes.  She woke up and Jerry choked her until she
"",,"went limp, raped her, stole her shoes, and fled the scene."
"",,"Jerry was electrocuted at work.  The 480 volt shock left him dazed, and with minor"
1967,28,
"",,damages but he was never hospitalized
"",,"1st Murder- Linda Slawson (WF, 22)- she was selling encyclopedias door to door and"
"",,"Jerry convinced her to come down to his workshop (lower garage), hit her with a"
01/26/1968,28,"two by four, and then strangled her to death. Before disposing of the body Jerry"
"",,removed her clothes and put several undergarments from his collection on the
"",,corpse.  He cut off her left foot and kept it in the freezer in a high-heeled shoe.
1968,28,Jerry faked a flat tire and dumped the body over a bridge.

"",,undergarments over her mangled chest.
"",,Jerry begins to phone dorm rooms at Oregon State University.  He is somehow able

"",,present.  A female student that claimed to have gone on one of the blind dates gives
"",,the police a description of Jerome Brudos.
"",,Jerry attempts to contact the same girl a second time.  The girl informed police and
"",,Jerry was questioned at the girl’s residence hall.  Jerry cooperated and his
May 25-,,"information came back legitimate so he was not arrested.  Subsequently, the police"

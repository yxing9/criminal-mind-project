Date  Year Age Life Event
"1876 Ed, father George Gein was born"
1900 Ed’s father (George) and mother (Augusta) were married.
""
January 17 1902 Ed’s older brother Henry was born
February 1902 Ed’s father is out of work
Edward Theodore Gein (Ed) was born to Augusta and George
"Gein in La Crosse, Wisconsin. A growth on his left eyelid caused"
August 27
Ed to have a “lazy” eye. Ed was the younger of two sons. The
"first born, Henry, was 5 years older."
George Gein was an abusive alcoholic who worked periodically
1906 0
"as a carpenter, a tanner, and a farmer. Augusta was a fanatically"
religious woman.
Augusta supported the family through a successful grocery
"business. She despised George, felt he was worthless, and gave"
him no part in raising the two boys.
Ed witnesses his parents slaughter a hog in the shed behind the
1913 7
family store. Ed experienced an ejaculation upon viewing this.
"",,,"The Geins moved to Plainfield, Wisconsin, to a 195 acre farm"
"",,,because Augusta wanted to move away from the immorality of
"",1914,8,
"",,,the city and the sinners that inhabited it. The closest neighbors
"",,,were almost a mile away.
"",,,"Ed and Henry began school at Roche-a-Cri grade school, a tiny"
"",,,"one-room building with 12 students. Ed was average at school,"
"",,,but an excellent reader. Ed was shunned and isolated at school
"",,,because of his lazy eye and his shyness. He also had a lesion on
"",,,his tongue that caused him to speak a bit weird. Augusta severely
"",1914,8,
"",,,punished Ed when he did attempt to make friends. Augusta
"",,,"verbally abused both boys, believing they were destined to"
"",,,become failures like their father.  Ed would come home crying
"",,,from kids making fun of him and his alcoholic father would
"",,,repeatedly beat him in the head till his ears started ringing.
"",,,Ed was caught by his mother masturbating in the bathtub.  She
"",1918,12,grabbed his genitals and called them the “curse of man”.
"",,,Ed graduated the eighth grade and then dropped out of school. He
"",1920,14,
"",,,continued to be an avid reader though.
"",1927,21,Augusta made both her sons promise to always remain virgins.
"",,,"George, Ed’s father, became a helpless invalid and was"
"",,,completely dependent on his family that feared and hated him.
"",1937,31,
"",,,George was no help on the farm and drank away much of the
"",,,family earnings.
"",,,George died of pneumonic fluid on the lungs at age 66. Augusta
"",,,attributed his death to his weakness and referred often to him
"",,,"going to hell. Ed and Henry, 39, began to take on odd jobs to"
April 1,1940,34,"help support the family, mostly as handymen. Ed was often"
"",,,employed as a babysitter. He loved the company of children
"",,,because they were easier to relate to. Both Ed and Henry were
"",,,considered trustworthy and reliable by the town’s people.
"",,,Ed was still eligible for the draft and had to travel to Milwaukee
"",,,for a physical exam. He was rejected due to the growth on his left
"",1942,36,"eyelid, which slightly impaired his vision. This was the farthest"
"",,,from home he had ever been and the only time in his life he
"",,,would travel so far.
"",,,"Henry, not sharing Ed’s worship of their mother, began to openly"
"",,,criticize her. Henry was worried about what he perceived to be
"",1944,38,
"",,,Ed’s unhealthy attachment to her. This criticism shocked and
"",,,mortified Ed.
"",,,Henry died a sudden death under mysterious circumstances at the
"",,,"age of 43, while he and Ed were fighting a runaway fire on the"
"",,,marshland near their home. Ed reported that he had been unable
May 16,1944,38,
"",,,"to locate Henry, but then led police directly to where he lay."
"",,,Apparent cause of death was not consistent with injuries from
"",,,"fire, Henry’s body had not been touched by the fire and his head"
"",,,was badly bruised.
"",,,The county corner listed Henry’s cause of death as asphyxiation.
May 18,1944,38,The police dismissed the notion of foul play. They did not
"",,,believe Ed was capable of killing someone.
"",(Late),,Augusta became faint and sickly not long after Henry’s death and
"",,38,
"",1944,,had to be hospitalized. Augusta had suffered her first stroke.
"",,,"Augusta became worried about Ed’s reading, which included"
"",1945,39,"head shrinking, grave robbing, and many books on human"
"",,,anatomy.
"",,,Augusta died of complications from a second stroke at age 67. Ed
December,,,reacted by boarding up his mother’s bedroom and sitting room to
"",1945,39,
29,,,"be preserved, museum style, as they had been when she was"
"",,,alive.
"",,,"Ed’s already unkempt appearance degrades further, neighbors"
"",,,comment on how bad ha smells. Ed continued to live on the farm
"",(Early),,
"",,40,and live off meager earnings form odd jobs. Ed then boarded up
"",1946,,
"",,,all but two rooms in the house. They were never reopened again
"",,,until his arrest.
"",,,"Eighteen months after Augusta died, Ed, driven by intense"
"",,,"loneliness and what he later said to be strange visions, began to"
"",,,visit the cemetery were his mother was buried. After several
"",1947,41,
"",,,"visits, he began to dig up corpses. The first body he dug up was"
"",,,"that of his mother. Twisting her head off with his bare hands, Ed"
"",,,took the head and shrunk it similar to the way his book spoke of.
"",,,"8-year-old, Georgia Weckler disappeared without a trace, leaving"
May 1,1947,41,
"",,,no suspects and the only clue found was tire tracks of a ford.
"",,,"Ed began making nocturnal visits to as many as 40 cemeteries,"
"",,,"frequently leaving without any offense, but on at least 9"
"",,,occasions Ed dug up the coffins of newly-buried middle-age
"",,,women. He had scouted these women out in the obituaries. He
"",,,would take what he wanted then recover the violated graves.
"",1947-,41-,
"",,,"Besides masturbation, Ed denies ever having has a sexual"
"",1951,45,
"",,,experience in his life and stated that he never had sex with the
"",,,cadavers because “they smelled too bad.” His cravings and
"",,,compulsions still fall under the category of necrophilia. An
"",,,"increase in missing persons in the area began at this time as well,"
"",,,stumping police.
"",,,Ed visited a bar owned by Mary Hogan. She was a middle-aged
"",,,"woman that looked much like Ed’s mother, but had a foul mouth"
"",1951,45,and a trashy history. Ed was transfixed by her because of the
"",,,resemblance to his mother as well as the glaring difference
"",,,between the two.
"",,,"Ed dug up Eleanor Adams, a 51 year old woman who had been"
August 26,1951,45,
"",,,buried earlier that day.
November,,,"Victor “Bunk” Travis, age 42, and friend, Ray Burgess,"
"",1952,46,
1,,,disappeared with the car after spending several hours at a local
"",,,bar in Plainfield. No trace of them or their car was ever found.
"",,,"While kidnapping men was out of character for Ed Gein, police"
"",,,still suspect he had some role in their disappearance.
"",,,"Evelyn Hartley, age 15, is abducted while baby-sitting for family"
"",,,"friends. Her father found signs of struggle, including her broken"
"",,,"eyeglasses, blood stains, and footprints. Her panties and bra were"
October 24,1953,47,
"",,,"found two miles southeast of La Crosse and four miles further,"
"",,,bloody pair of man’s pants was found. Her body was never
"",,,found. It is thought that Ed was responsible.
"",,,"Plainfield tavern owner, Mary Hogan, with whom Ed has earlier"
"",,,"been transfixed, disappeared from her establishment. Police"
December,,,suspected foul play because of blood on the floor next to an
"",1954,48,
8,,,empty bullet shell casing. Ed later revealed that he had been
"",,,"hanging out with her, drinking a bit. He pulled the blinds, put a"
"",,,.22 caliber gun to her forehead and shot her.
"",,,"The day after the murder, while working with Elmo Ueeck, he"
December,,,admitted to killing her and said he had hung her up at his house.
"",1954,48,
9,,,"Elmo dismissed Ed’s statement, not believing him."
November,,,Ed inquired from Mrs. Worden and her son about the price of
"",1957,51,
15,,,antifreeze.
"",,,Owner of the local International Harvest Products shop and
"",,,"mother of Deputy Frank Worden, Bernice Worden, 58,"
"",,,disappeared from her store. Sheriff Schley and Deputy Worden
November,,,
"",1957,51,"found the cash register gone, blood on the floor, and a .22 caliber"
16,,,
"",,,rifle that was out of place on it’s rack upon arrival at the store.
"",,,"They also found a receipt for antifreeze made out to Eddie Gein,"
"",,,the last sale of the day.
"",,,Sheriff Schley and Deputy Worden entered Ed Gein’s house
"",,,through the shed/ summer kitchen. Bernice Worden’s headless
"",,,corpse was found hanging upside down with her ankles lashed to
"",,,a wooden cross beam. She was split open from vagina to
"",,,"sternum, field dressed like a deer. In addition, the police found"
November,,,
"",1957,51,"human skulls affixed to the posts of Ed’s bed, a box of organs,"
17,,,
"",,,"furniture made out of bone and skin, and masks. The masks were"
"",,,the skin portion of the head that had been stripped away from the
"",,,skull and preserved. Also found was a belt with breasts hanging
"",,,from it and an entire “suit” made of pieced together skin of
"",,,"women, complete with a vest with breasts attached."
"",,,"After remaining silent at first, Ed confessed to Killing Mary"
November,,,
"",1957,51,Hogan and Bernice Worden. An autopsy report reveals that Mrs.
18,,,
"",,,Worden died of a single gunshot wound to the back of the head.
November,,,The search of the 195 acre farm property began and lasted over a
"",1957,51,
19,,,week.
November,,,Lie detector test results were released to the press. Ed was also
"",1957,51,
21,,,responsible for the disappearance of E
"",,,"Ed was taken before a judge, technically being charged with"
November,,,
"",1957,51,robbery. The murder charge was held back in order to determine
22,,,
"",,,his sanity.
November,,,The psychologist and psychiatrist who interview Ed asserted that
"",1957,51,
23,,,he was schizophrenic and a “sexual psychopath.”
November,,,Graves the Ed supposedly robbed were opened. The grave of
"",1957,51,
24,,,Mrs. Adams was found empty.
November,,,Deputies found more bones buried in trench on Ed’s farm. One
"",1957,51,
29,,,skull had a gold tooth and was believed to be the skull of a man.
December,,,Ed complained of memory deficits during an interview with Dr.
"",1957,51,
9,,,E.F. Schubert at the Central State hospital.
December,,,Ed was interviewed by Dr. E.F. Schubert. Schubert found that Ed
"",1957,51,
12,,,had an “abnormally magnified attachment to his mother.”
"",,,The judge received a packet from Central State Hospital stating
December,,,
"",1957,51,that Ed was insane and should be permanently committed to the

March 20,1958,52,"March 30, but was destroyed in a fire during the early morning"
"",,,hours.
"",,,"After spending ten years in the institution, Ed was determined"
"",,,competent to stand trial and proceeding began. It took 9 months
January 22,1968,62,

"",,,Ed was found guilty of first degree murder for the shooting of

"",,,Ed filed a petition with the Waushara County Clerk of Courts
"",,,claiming that he had now recovered his mental health and was
February,1974,68,
"",,,fully competent and there was no reason why he should remain in

"•Pee Wee’s mother, Molly, was a poor girl who quit school at the age of 12 to help her"
"family pick cotton and plant tobacco.  She had sex with Mr. Gaskins, a wealthy, well-"
"known neighbor of Molly, who loved to gamble and drink. He paid Molly $1 for sex"
03/13/1933 0 several times a week. She got pregnant at 14 and Mr. Gaskins paid Molly $10 a month
and allowed her to live in a small three-bedroom shack with their child. Pee Wee was
"born on March 13, 1933 and weighed only four pounds. He was given the name Pee"
Wee because of his small height and weight.
"•Throughout Pee Wee’s childhood, Molly and Mr. Gaskins would have sex in front of"
Pee Wee. They would often laugh at Pee Wee when they were having sex and push
him away when he tried to make them stop.
•Molly had many lovers and also had sex with several men for money throughout Pee
Wee’s childhood. Many of the men involved in Molly’s life were alcoholics and would
often abuse and sexual assault Pee Wee while his mother watched.
•Pee Wee was teased and made fun of in school by the other children because of his
small size and bruises. Pee Wee’s teachers blamed Pee Wee for his problems with the
other children and he would often receive beatings from the teachers for not getting
along with the other kids. Eventually Pee Wee hated going to school so he would hide
out in the woods all day instead of going until he finally quit school at the age of 8.
"•In 1943, Pee Wee’s mother married Hinnant Hanna, a field hand who also mistreated"
"1943 10 Pee Wee, much like Molly’s past lovers. After marrying Hanna, Molly had two sons"
"and two daughters, Pee Wee’s half brothers and sisters."
"•At the age of 12, Pee Wee started working at an auto garage. Pee Wee had become"
"known around town for his ability to fix things including toys, fans and other"
appliances.
"1945 12 •Despite the fact that Pee Wee was a successful mechanic and making good money,"
his stepfather made Pee Wee quit working at the auto-garage so he could work in the
fields. Occasionally Pee Wee would sneak away to work on cars and make extra
money.
"•When Pee Wee was thirteen, he found a small shack in the woods, which he and his"
1946 13
friends named the hideout. Pee Wee and his friends Danny Smith and Henry Marsh
"",,referred to themselves as the Trouble Trio and they would steal candy and cigarettes
"",,from vending machines and then sneak back to the hideout.
"",,"•That same year, the Trouble Trio got in trouble at church for peeping on the girls in"
"",,the women’s outhouse. They were given beatings from their parents but Pee Wee
"",,stated that he was not sad for what they did but sad that they were caught.
"",,"•At fifteen, with the help of Danny’s father, the Trouble Trio began breaking into"
"",,homes throughout the area and they would sell whatever they stole at local yards. With
"",,their earnings the boys were able to buy their own car and would drive to Fort Jackson
"",,"or Columbia, SC to get prostitutes."
"",,•Soon the boys were no longer interested in having sex with prostitutes and wanted to
"",,"know what it was like to have sex with a virgin. To fulfill their curiosity, all three boys"
1948,15,
"",,"raped Henry’s 13-year old sister, Julie, multiple times and in many different ways."
"",,Julie immediately told her mother what the boys did to her. Julie’s mother informed
"",,the other parents and the boys received intense physical beatings as punishment.  Soon
"",,"after the rape, Henry and Danny’s families moved away and the group was split up."
"",,This experience was Pee Wee’s first at violent sex and he described it as being a very
"",,fulfilling part of his life.
"",,"•In 1948, Pee Wee met another partner named Walt at a Car Shop and they soon"
"",,created a plan to break into homes and sell the stolen goods for profit.
"",,"•During one of Pee Wee and Walt’s heists, they broke into a house that was not empty."
"",,A 16-year old girl was home and attacked Pee Wee with a hatchet when she realized
"",,the two men were robbing her family. Pee Wee was able to get the hatchet away from
1948,15,the girl and Pee Wee hit her hard in the head with it causing her to become
"",,unconscious. Walt was able to get away from the robbery untouched but Pee Wee was
"",,charged with assault with a deadly weapon and intent to kill. During Pee Wee’s trial it
"",,was the first time he learned that his name was really Donald Henry Gaskins and not
"",,Pee Wee. Pee Wee was found guilty and was sent to The South Carolina Industrial
"",,"School For Boys in Florence, South Carolina."
"",,•Pee Wee went to reform school in 1950  The first night Pee Wee spent at the reform
"",,"school he was approached by Boss Poss who was one of the main leaders at the school,"
"",,Poss informed Pee Wee that he would be his “sweetheart” from now on and was told
"",,"to go to Poss’s bed each night or else. When Pee Wee did not obey, the following night"
"",,Poss and about 20 of his followers raped and sodomized Pee Wee many times. During
"",,"Pee Wee’s first year at the reform school, Pee Wee was Boss’s sweetheart and Poss"
"",,raped Pee Wee each night. Poss would also sell Pee Wee for sex so that Poss could get
"",,cigarettes.
"",,
"",,"•After almost a year of sexual and emotional abuse at the reform school, Pee Wee and"
"",,four other boys who were also raped by Poss’s followers ran away from the school.
"",,The next day the police picked up the boys while they were hiding out in the woods.
"",,"When the officers were not looking, Pee Wee managed to run away again and ran"
"",,straight to his old hideout. He was found two days later and was given lashes for thirty
"",,"days, three months hard labor, and three months solitary confinement as punishment"
"",,for running away. Although Pee Wee hated solitary confinement because he liked to
"",,"socialize, he was not beaten or raped by Poss or the other boys."
"",,•When Pee Wee was out of solitary confinement he continued to get raped by Poss and
"",,his followers each night. Once they even forced Pee Wee to run around in girls’
"",,"underwear. In 1949, Pee Wee could not handle the abuse anymore so decided to run"
"",,away from the reform school again but this time with only one other boy. After
"",,"escaping, Pee Wee went to his Aunt’s house and she agreed to let him stay as long as"
"",,he stayed out of trouble and helped around the house. It was the first time Pee Wee felt
1949,16,
"",,"he had a mother figure in his life. After three months, Pee Wee’s aunt convinced Pee"
"",,Wee to turn himself in and finish his sentence at the reform school so he would not
"",,have to live a life on the run.
"",,•Once Pee Wee arrived back at the reform school he was given solitary confinement
"",,"and hard labor. Each day, the guards would have reasons to give Pee Wee additional"
"",,"lashes.  One day, after being punished for no reason by a guard, Pee Wee punched the"
"",,guard in the face and then again in the testicles. Pee Wee was then sent to the state
"",,hospital for mental evaluation.
"",,•Pee Wee was only in the mental hospital for one day when his appendix ruptured and
"",,he was sent to a hospital.
"",,"•After treatment, Pee Wee was sent back to the reform school and was given light duty"
"",,"for three months. Immediately after light duty had ended, the guards and Poss beat and"
"",,"raped Pee Wee every day until he once again ran away, this time by himself."
"",,"•Met and married Mary. The day after they had been married, he turned himself into"
01/22/1951,18,the reform school so that he and Mary would not have to live a life on the run. He
"",,finished reform school.

"",,"there for a few months until Slick, one of Pee Wee's friends from reform school,"
"",,offered Pee Wee and Mary  to work for him on his tobacco farm as well as  a three
"",,"bedroom house in Johnstonville, SC and a pick-up truck"
"",,•Starts burning tobacco farms for large sums of money. Their daughter was born on
"",,"April 17, 1952; Slick got arrested for arson but did not turn in Pee Wee. Due to Slick’s"

"",,other inmates that he was not powerless. Pee Wee came up with a plan to kill Hazal
1953,20,"Brazell, the most powerful man in the prison. Because he made the murder look like he"
"",,"was defending himself, he only received solitary confinement for a few months. When"

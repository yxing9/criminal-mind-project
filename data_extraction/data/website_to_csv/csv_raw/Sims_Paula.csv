ideology.
"",,"Family moved to Wood River, Illinois – Cottage Hills. Paula made new friends with June Bland"
05/1976,17,and Rhonda Henson who she met in Civic Memorial High School. These became long-term
"",,friendships.
1977,18,"Graduated from high school – name in yearbook, no picture – known as loner"
"",,"Went to Lewis and Clark Community College for a year, keypunch program. She did not finish"
1978,19,"program. Bought first car, blue ‘69 Maverick. Went to work as cashier at the National Food Store"
"",,on Godfrey road in Godfrey.
"",,"Song came out called “Lorelei”, told her friend, June that she was going to name her first daughter"
1978/1979,19/20,"Lorelei. Paula often spoke of having children, wanted girls. Her brother Dennis’s seizures became"
"",,"worse, causing her mother to become severely depressed."
"",,Introduced to Robert “Rob” Sims by her friend June’s cousin. Paula and Rob went to rock concert
1979/1980,20/21,
"",,together.
05/02/1981,22,Married Robert Sims
01/1983,24,"Rob and Paula moved to Brighton, Illinois"
"",,"Called her friend June, and told her that she and Robert were planning on starting a family,"
"",,because they bought a house and were financially stable. Became friends with Minnie and Don
01/1984,25,
"",,"Gray, their neighbors. Minnie and Paula became fast friends, and Paula talked to her about"
"",,children.
06/05/1986,27,"First child, a daughter, Loralei Marie Sims, was born at 6:03 p.m."
"",,"Loralei was stolen from the family’s home late at night, supposedly by a man dressed in black,"
"",,"who held a gun on Paula, forcing her to lie on the basement floor, while he then took Loralei from"
"",,"the house. Paula ran to her neighbor’s home, the Grays, and told them that Loralei had been taken"
"",,by someone. Minnie Gray told her husband to call the police. Minnie went back to the Sims’ home
"",,after Paula to stay with her until the police arrived on the scene. She let out the family’s dog by
06/17/1986,27,"accident, and Paula got him back in, stating I can’t lose you too. Minnie remembered Paula telling"
"",,"her that the dog barked at anyone who came near their home, and she asked Paula if the dog had"
"",,"barked, because she did not hear him. Paula said that he didn’t bark, because he must have been in"
"",,"another room in the basement and did not hear the intruder, which Minnie felt was very weird,"
"",,"because the dog barked all the time, and could not see how a man breaking into their home would"
"",,go unnoticed by this dog.
"",,"Loralei’s remains were found. Not sure if actual date, it was week after she was reported"
"",,kidnapped from her home. The skeletal remains were found 150 feet behind the family’s home in
06/24/1986,27,the woods. A raccoon had carried the body down the hill. Police were not sure when the baby had
"",,"died, they theorized maybe two days before she was reported missing by the parents, making them"
"",,the top suspects in the death of their daughter.
"",,"Police later learned after investigating the murder of Loralei, that Paula had taken the baby out to"
"",,"Jack’s Hallmark Card Shop, in Jerseyville, the morning of the 14th, which was the day before"
06/14/1986,27,"father’s day. Paula had lied to the police, stating she had never taken the baby out of the house."
"",,This gave the police reason to doubt the Sims’ statements about the case. The Sims was already
"",,"suspects in the police’s eyes, and this did not help them."
"",,Detective Gantner told the Post-Dispatch that there was no way to prove that the remains found on
07/11/1986,27,June 24th  were the remains of Loralei. They were not able to set cause of death either.  The only
"",,thing they had left to identify the remains was bone marrow to match blood type with the mother.
"",,"Detectives Yocom and Plummer decided to contact the FBI, to see if there was another way to"
"",,identify the remains. They were told of a new kind of test which was available using genetic
7/1986,27,"factors in the blood. The test was only being performed in two laboratories at this time, one in"
"",,"Phoenix, and the other in Atlanta. They chose Dr. Schanfield at the Allo Type Genetic Testing,"
"",,"Inc. laboratory in Atlanta, to do the testing."
"",,"Loralei’s remains were delivered to the Allo laboratory, along with blood samples from Paula. Ten"
"",,"days later, the results arrived. Detective Yocom read through three pages of the report before"
08/19/1986,27,"finding the answer on the third page, it was Loralei’s remains. It was 97.2 percent certain. Dr."
"",,Schanfield had stated that only 95 percent was required to be accepted in court as positive
"",,identification of the remains.
09/27/1986,27,"Loralei was buried in a private ceremony, at the Woodland Hills Cemetery, in East Alton."
01/1987,28,Robert and Paula moved to new home at 1053 Washington Avenue in Alton.
03/12/1987,28,"Detective Plummer gave a subpoena to the Sims for more information only. He felt this might alsoserve as a reminder that the authorities were still watching them. The Sims went to the courthousein Jerseyville. The Sims’s lawyer Mr. Sherwood filed a motion to quash the subpoenas. Thismotion was denied by Circuit Court Judge Claude Davis."
06/17/1987,29,First anniversary of Loralei’s death.
02/01/1988,29,"Second child was born, Randall Troy. Named after Paula’s brother Randy, and Robert’s fatherTroy. They were very happy at the birth of a son... Paula stated later on, that she had threatenedRandall’s life over crying."
03/18/1989,30,"Third child, Heather was born."
04/29/1989,30,"Heather was reported by Paula to have been taken from their home in Alton late at night. Paula hadstated that she was taking out the trash and someone hit her in back of the head. Medical examinerfound no forensic evidence to prove that Paula had been struck in the back of the head. Robert hadcorroborated her story, stating that when he got home she was found lying on the floor, and thebaby was gone. They went to look for her, and then called the police. Eerily similar events to threeyears before, where Paula had stated someone had kidnapped Loralei."
05/03/1989,30,"Heather’s remains were found at Lock & Dam 26, at Alton lake. Found by Charles Saunders at7:00 p.m. in a trash barrel near the edge of the parking lot, in a black trash bag. The body showssigns of frost bite, where the medical examiner believed she may have been put into a freezer andkept there for a few days.  Paula’s DNA was found on the trash bag the baby was found in."
01/11/1990,30,"Paula is charged with the death of Heather. She was only suspected in the death of Loralei, andwas never charged due to lack of forensic evidence. Paula went to court in Peoria, Illinois. JudgeAndy Matoesian presided over the case. Prosecutor was Donald Weber, and Defense for Paula wasDonald Groshong. The case was in court for a little over two days. The jury deliberated for tenhours. Robert was not charged in the deaths, even though he was suspected of being anaccomplice. The police believed he helped hide the babies’ bodies."
01/31/1990,30,"Paula was found guilty of first degree murder in the death of Heather. She was also charged withobstruction of justice and concealing a homicide. No charges had been filed on this date for thedeath of Loralei, due to lack of forensic evidence."
02/1990,30,"Paula admitted to killing her infant daughter Loralei on 06/17/86, and admitted to killing herdaughter Heather on 04/29/89. She stated that it was post-partum depression for both deaths, andthat she had post-partum with her son Randall, and had threatened him after he would not stopcrying one day, but was able to control herself enough to keep from killing him as well."
02/1990,30,"Paula received a sentence of life without parole. Robert obtained custody of Randall. She wasconvicted on one count of first degree murder, two counts of obstructing justice, and one count ofconcealing a homicide, as well as three counts of obstructing justice."
06/11/2001,42,"Appeal heard, People vs. Sims, in the Appellate court of Illinois, Fifth district. The appeal wasmade by Paula stating ineffective assistance of counsel by her attorney Donald Groshong. Thejudge denied post-conviction relief. She wanted a new trial to prove she suffered from post-partumdepression psychosis."

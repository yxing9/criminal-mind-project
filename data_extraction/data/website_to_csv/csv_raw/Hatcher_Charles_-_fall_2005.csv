"Watched his older brother, Arthur Allen Hatcher die of electrocution. The"
brothers were flying a kite with copper wire they found in an old Model T

The company reported that one of the trucks had been stolen. Hatcher
bought the company truck back that morning.  He was intoxicated at the
"October 9, 1947 18 time and admitted to stealing the truck. He was convicted of his first crime"
"which was auto theft in St. Joseph, Missouri. He received a two-year"
suspended sentence.

Missouri washing dishes and doing other odd jobs. Convicted of auto theft

Hatcher was sentenced to two years in Missouri State Penitentiary.
"February 7, 1948 18 Hatcher was received at the prison for the 1st time."
Hatcher was released from prison after serving a little less than 3⁄4 of his
"June 8, 1949 18"
time.
"Convicted of forgery for a $10 check at a gas station in Maryville,"
"October 10, 1949 19 Missouri. Hatcher was sentenced to three years in Missouri State"
Penitentiary.
"March 18, 1951 21 Escaped from prison, but was caught and received an extra two years."
"",,While he was out he also attempted a burglary.
"July 14, 1954",24,After serving his additional time he was released from prison.
"",,"Hatcher stole a 1951 Ford in Orrick, Missouri.  He was then sentenced to 4"
"",,years for the car theft.  During his imprisonment at Ray County Jail in
"February 5, 1955",25,
"",,"Richmond, Missouri, Hatcher received an additional two years for"
"",,attempted escape.
"March 18, 1959",29,Released from prison after the fifth and sixth sentences of his career.
"",,Hatcher attempted to abduct a 16-year old St. Joseph newspaper boy. He
"",,"threatened the young boy with a butcher knife, making this the first"
"June 26, 1959",29,
"",,recorded violent crime of his life. The boy reported the crime and Hatcher
"",,was arrested when the police stopped him in a stolen vehicle.
"",,Hatcher was sentenced to five years in the Missouri State Penitentiary for
"November 20, 1959",30,
"",,the attempted abduction and auto theft under the Habitual Criminal Act.
"",,"Hatcher was waiting to be transported to the Missouri State Penitentiary,"
"November 21, 1959",30,where he attempted to break out of the Buchanan County Jail. Hatcher was
"",,unsuccessfully.
"",,Hatcher arrived at the Missouri State Penitentiary for his fourth tour.  At
"November 25, 1959",30,this point Hatcher was starting to state his claim as being the most
"",,notorious criminal in the northwest of Missouri since Jesses James.
"",,"Jerry Tharrington, a fellow inmate of Hatcher’s at the penitentiary, was"
"",,found raped and stabbed to death on the prison’s kitchen loading dock.
"July 2, 1961",31,
"",,Hatcher was the only one missing from the kitchen crew at the time of the
"",,murder.
"",,"Hatcher was sent to solitary confinement for the Tharrington’s murder,"
"August 21, 1961",32,since there was not enough evidence to convict him in court. This was the
"",,only punishment available.
"",,"Hatcher, still in solitary confinement from the murder, sent a note to the"
"",,"Major at the penitentiary, claiming that he realized he needed"
"",,"psychological treatment. However, the prison psychologist felt that it was"
"January 18, 1962",32,
"",,all a scheme to get out of solitary and possibly out of prison early.
"",,"Treatment was refused, and many believe that if he had gotten treatment,"
"",,the remainder of his life may have gone in an entirely different direction.
"",,Hatcher was returned to the general population at the prison and his
"October, 1962",33,
"",,sentenced was reduced to 3⁄4 the original time.
"August 24, 1963",34,Hatcher was released from the penitentiary.
"",,"Hatcher confessed to abducting a boy in Antioch, California.  The boy was"
"",,riding down the street on his bicycle and he had a tennis racket with him.
"August 27, 1969",40,
"",,Hatcher told the boy to take a ride with him.  Hatcher drove to a creek and
"",,strangled the boy with his hands.
"",,A 6-year old Hispanic boy was reported missing at 5:00 p.m. in San
"",,"Francisco, California. The boy had been last seen walking away with a"
"",,"man that offered him ice cream, as reported by the six-year old girl he was"
"",,playing with. The boy was found by a man walking his dog in the middle
"August 29, 1969",40,of the sexual assault and beating. Police arrived in time and arrested the
"",,man who wouldn’t answer any questions except saying his name was
"",,Albert Ralph Price; the identification found on him was from a man named
"",,Hobert Prater. The boy survived the horrifying assault. FBI records finally
"",,identified the man as Charles R. Hatcher.
"",,"Hatcher, still going by the name Albert Price, was brought before a judge"
"",,in California for the charges of assault with attempt to commit sodomy and
"September 12, 1969",40,
"",,kidnapping. Psychiatric evaluations were ordered to determine Hatcher’s
"",,competence.
"",,A complete mental evaluation during a 90-day stay at California State
"September, 25, 1969",40,Hospital was ordered after Hatcher was completely unresponsive during
"",,the preliminary evaluations. This was the first time Hatcher faked mental
"",,"illness and avoided prison. During his time at the hospital, Hatcher"
"",,claimed he heard voices and faked delusions of persecution. He pretended
"",,to be confused and faked a few suicide attempts for effect.
"September 30, 1969",40,Hatcher began the 1st of his five tours of the California State Hospital.
"",,Hatcher was repeatedly sent back to the courts from the hospital;
"",,psychologists’ saying that he was competent to stand trial and each time
"",,being sent back to the hospital. One psychiatrist at the hospital identified
"December, 1970",41,him as having a passive-aggressive personality with sexual deviation and
"",,pedophilia. It was also reported that the staff felt Hatcher was malingering.
"",,The hospital decided once again that he was competent to stand trial and
"",,once again the judge ordered two more evaluations.
"",,The first psychiatrist concluded that Hatcher was insane and recommended
"January 21, 1971",41,
"",,vigorous treatment in a secure hospital.
"",,"The second psychiatrist, who referred to Hatcher as “Mr. Prince,”"
"January 22, 1971",41,concluded that he was incompetent to stand trial and sent him back to the
"",,hospital.
"",,Hatcher was finally sent to trial and pleaded not guilty by reason of
"May 24, 1971",41,"insanity. Once again, Hatcher was sent for evaluations, this time at a"
"",,different hospital and it was concluded that he could not stand trial.
"",,The actual examination took place with both Hatcher ( Albert Price) and
"",,"Dr. Carl Drake, Jr. He lied about his life history to the doctor.  Many"
"May 27, 1971",41,
"",,doctor’s had relied on the words of convicted inmates on the accounts of
"",,their lives.
"",,Hatcher escaped from the hospital. He was caught a week later 90 miles
"June 2, 1971",41,"away in Colusa, California. He was arrested under suspicion of auto theft"
"",,and went by the name Richard Lee Grady.
"",,Hatcher was returned to the California State Hospital for an evaluation of a
"July 15, 1971",41,
"",,"mental disorder, where he was recognized by the staff."
"",,After finally deciding that Hatcher’s treatment was going nowhere and that
"April 4, 1972",42,"he was endangering other patients, he was sent to the prison state hospital"
"",,at Vacaville.
"",,"Hatcher was transferred to San Quentin Prison, and finally would be"
"August, 1972",43,
"",,"forced to trial, three years after the crime."
"",,"After it was determined that he was capable of rational thinking, based on"
"",,"a letter he wrote to his public defender, Hatcher was ordered two final"
"October 24, 1972",43,
"",,examinations. One would determine if he was competent to stand trial and
"",,the other would determine of he was sane at the time of the crime.
"",,Hatcher was finally tried for the abduction and molestation of the Hispanic
"December 12, 1972",43,
"",,boy. He was convicted of the charges.
"",,Hatcher was committed to the California State Hospital as a mentally
"January, 9 1973",43,
"",,disordered sexual offender.
"",,Around 5:00 p.m. the security guards found Hatcher hiding in a cooler
"",,near the main courtyard of the hospital.  There were two sheets stuffed into
"March 28, 1973",43,his pants.  He admitted to the guards he was attempting to escape from the
"",,hospital. The doctors felt that he was still a threat to society and he was
"",,sent back to court for sentencing.
"",,"Sent to a medium-security prison in Vacaville, California with a sentence"
"April 27, 1973",43,
"",,of one year to life in prison.
"",,"A psychologist, W.D. Lewis, interviewed Hatcher at the reception center"
May 1973,43,
"",,and found him to be a “manipulative institutionalized sociopath.”
"",,Hatcher was recommended for transfer to a maximum security prison. He
"",,slashed his wrists because he didn’t want to be sent to one of those
"June 15, 1973",43,"prisons. A psychiatrist concluded that had paranoia and schizophrenia,"
"",,which saved him from the maximum security prison. He remained at
"",,Vacaville.
"",,Guards stated at the parole review that Hatcher was not a custodial
August 1975,45,
"",,problem and had performed his tasks well in the hospital kitchen.
"",,The California Parole Board found that Hatcher had improved
"",,"dramatically through his time in prison, which was two years, seven"
"June 25, 1976",45,"months, and seventeen days based on various reviews. Talk of parole"
"",,began. After continued treatment and rehabilitation a parole date was set
"",,"for December 25, 1978."
"",,Hatcher received a modified parole date that led him to be released 19
"",,months earlier than expected. A bill had been passed that would give credit
"January 3, 1977",47,
"",,"to inmates for time spent not only in jails, but in mental health facilities as"
"",,well.
"",,"Hatcher was released to Home Care Services Center, a halfway house in"
"May 20, 1977",47,
"",,"San Francisco, California."
"",,Hatcher was supposed to report back to the half-way house every night at
"",,"9:00 p.m. and take a total of nine prescribed pills. Five days later, Hatcher"
"May 25, 1977",47,
"",,violated the terms of his parole and was on the run. He was considered a
"",,“walk-away.”
"",,Hatcher was declared a “parolee at large” and besides a sighting in
"June 13, 1977",47,
"",,"Wilmar, Minnesota, was not seen for about a year."
"",,"Eric Christgen (WM, 4) was abducted and murdered in St. Joseph,"
"May 27, 1978",48,
"",,Missouri.
"",,"Hatcher was arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, 150 miles north of St. Joseph,"
"September 4, 1978",49,
"",,Missouri for a sexual attack on a 16-year old boy.
"",,"Hatcher was arrested for molesting a teenage boy, attempting to stab a 7"
"",,"year old boy, fighting over payment for sex with a young man.  All these"
Fall 1978 and Spring,,
"",,"crime were in Omaha, Nebraska.  Hatcher also molested a man in Lincoln,"
of 1982,,
"",,"Nebraska, attempted to stab a man in Des Moines, and abducted an 11 year"
"",,"old boy from a shopping mall in Bettendorf, Iowa."
"",,"Released from Douglas County Mental Hospital in Omaha, where he had"
"",,been for the sexual attack in September 1978. He had been arrested under
"January 31, 1979",49,"the name Richard Clark, and records indicate that he may never have been"
"",,identified as Hatcher during his time there. None of the jurisdictions that
"",,Hatcher encountered bothered to process his fingerprints.
"",,Man by the name of Melvin Reynolds was falsely accused and convicted
"February 14, 1979",49,"to life in prison for the Christgen murder, which was committed by"
"",,Hatcher.
"",,Hatcher was arrested again in Omaha for assault and attempting to kill a 7
"May 3, 1979",49,year old boy. Charges were dropped and he was sent to another mental
"",,health facility.
"",,Hatcher was released only to return two months later for another assault
"May 21, 1980",50,
"",,charge.
"September 6, 1980",51,Escaped from Norfolk Regional Center
"",,"Arrested under the name Richard Clark in Lincoln, Nebraska for attempted"
"October 9, 1980",51,assault and sodomy of a 17-year old male. He was discharged from the
"",,mental health facility he was sent to only 21 days later.
"",,"Arrested again under the name Richard Clark in Des Moines, Iowa after a"
"January 13, 1981",51,knife fight. He spent a short amount of time in various Iowa mental health
"",,facilities.
"April 10, 1981",51,"Hatcher was discharged to a Salvation Army shelter in Davenport, Iowa."
"",,"James L. Churchill (WM, 34) was stabbed to death on the banks of the"
"",,"Mississippi River near Rock Island, Illinois. Hatcher eventually confessed"
"",,that Churchill and he had been drinking heavily and he felt the impulse to
"June 20, 1981",51,
"",,kill growing inside of him.  He stabbed Churchill until the knife became
"",,"imbedded in a bone to the right of his chest, near the heart.  He stabbed"
"",,Churchill a total of 10 or 12 times.
"",,"Arrested in Bettendorf, Iowa for attempting to abduct an 11-year old boy"
"",,from a grocery store. The boy was able to run and when the police arrested
"July 16, 1981",52,
"",,"Hatcher, he again went by the name of Richard Clark. Ironically this was"
"",,Hatcher’s birthday.
"",,The charges were dropped but Hatcher was sent to a mental hospital in
"March 18, 1982",52,
"",,"Mount Pleasant, Iowa on an involuntary commitment."
"May 7, 1982",52,"After staying there only 49 days, Hatcher was released."
"",,A young woman was accosted by a strange man in a downtown shopping
"",,"mall in St. Joseph, Missouri.  The man wanted to take her for a walk and"
"July 27, 1982",53,buy her a cup of coffee.  The woman was frightened by the man and told
"",,him to leave her alone.  This encounter took place only half a block down
"",,from where Eric Christgen was abducted 4 years earlier.
"",,Hatcher abducted a 10-year old boy. The abduction took place outside of a
"",,"mall in St. Joseph, Missouri.  The boy had been browsing in a record shop"
"July 28, 1982",53,at the mall when a man grabbed him by the shoulder and announced he
"",,was a security guard. The boy got away from Hatcher and went to find his
"",,grandmother.The man escaped before the police arrived.
"",,There was a brief report in the St. Joseph Gazette on the attempted
"July 29, 1982",53,
"",,abduction of the boy.
"",,"Michelle Steele (WF, 11) was abducted and murdered in St. Joseph. She"
"",,"was going to a dentist appointment downtown in St. Joseph, Missouri. She"
"July 29, 1982",53,went to her dentist appointment which was at 10:30 a.m. and left around
"",,"11:30 a.m. When her mother, Annette Steele returned home at 3:15 and"
"",,"noticed that her daughter was not present, she called the police."
"",,"The uncle of the missing girl, Roy Montgomery, was continuing the search"
"",,when he noticed something white between two logs.  It was Michelle
"July 30, 1982",53,Steele’s lifeless body laying there between the two logs.  The body was
"",,found less than a mile downstream from where Eric Christgen’s body was
"",,found earlier.
"",,Hatcher voluntarily checked into the St. Joseph State Hospital under the
"July 30, 1982",53,
"",,"name Richard Clark, claiming that he was hearing voices."
"",,"Hatcher, under the name Richard Clark, was charged with first degree"
"",,murder for the murder of Michelle Steele and the bond was set for
"",,"$250,000. Hatcher had been identified by the police as the man they had"
"August 3, 1982",53,"seen by the river, as well as picked out of photo lineups by the two"
"",,"attempted abductees. Sufficient evidence had been found: nylon cords, his"
"",,"knapsack, his teeth matched the bite marks on the girl’s body, and his"
"",,shoes matched the imprints in the soil near the body.
"",,Hatcher received his first mental examination in this case and it was
"August 13, 1982",53,concluded that he could understand his charges and didn’t need to be sent
"",,to another mental hospital.
"",,Hatcher pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. A second
"September 12, 1982",53,
"",,examination was ordered.
"",,During this examination he was injected with a truth serum. In the
"",,"questioning, Hatcher claimed that voices and demons told him to “sacrifice"
"December 2, 1982",53,
"",,the maiden.” The doctors believed that these were simply excuses he had
"",,come up with himself to justify his violence.
"",,"A trial date was, but was missed but of his lack of competence to stand"
"December 6, 1982",53,
"",,trial.
"",,Hatcher was ruled competent to stand trial for the 1st degree murder in the
"April 19, 1983",53,death of Michelle Steele.  A new trial date was set for June 6th.
"",,"Hatcher was spending time at Buchanan County Jail, awaiting his trial. He"
"",,gave a scrap of paper to a deputy that said: “Please call the FBI and tell
"May 3, 1983",53,
"",,them I would like to see them today. Very important case.” When Hatcher
"",,"met with FBI agent Joe Holtstag, he gave him a map that directed him to"
"",,"the body of James Churchill. He didn’t admit to killing him, so it was"
"",,assumed that this was just to gain credibility. He told Holtstag that there
"",,"were 16 bodies, 13 adults, and all were male. Holtstag got his first pieces"
"",,of information that would lead to the discovery that the wrong man was in
"",,"jail for the murder of Eric Christgen. During this interview, it became clear"
"",,that Hatcher would trade details about the murder for the death penalty; he
"",,wanted to be put to death
"",,Hatcher was finally charged under his real name. He was listed as using
"",,"the aliases: Richard Martin Clark, Richard Harris, Richard Mark Clark,"
"",,"Richard Lee Grady, Richard Lee Price, Earl L. Kalebough, Albert Aire,"
"May 28, 1983",53,
"",,"Charles Marvin Tidwell, Hobart Prater, Ronald Springer, Doris Mullins,"
"",,"Carl L. Kalebough, Albert Ralph Price, Doris Mullins Travis, and Dwayne"
"",,Lee Wilfong. He had used six Social Security numbers in his career.
"",,After Hatcher’s cell was searched by impatient officers still waiting for his
"June 6, 1983",53,
"",,"confessions, he told Holtstag that he had flushed his diary of the murders."
"",,"The two attorneys, Dahms and Morrey had obtained a change of venue for"
"June 20, 1983",53,
"",,"Hatcher’s trial and the date was set fro August 22, 1983."
"",,"Hatcher finally wrote a detailed account, containing evidence no on else"
"July 25, 1983",54,"would know, about the Christgen case. Holtstag received this letter on the"
"",,27th of July.
"",,Hatcher confessed to the murder of James Churchill in 1981 and William
"",,Freeman in 1969. During this same interview he was questioned by other
"",,"detectives about killing Eric Christgen. By the end of this interview,"
"August 3, 1983",54,
"",,"Hatcher had filled out a timeline of his career from his October 27, 1947"
"",,"arrest for auto theft to his July 29, 1982, which was the arrest for the"
"",,Michelle Steele murder.
"",,The grand jury met and felt they had heard enough evidence to indict
"September 1, 1983",54,
"",,Hatcher on capital murder charges of Michelle Steele.
"",,Hatcher was indicted by the Buchanan County grand jury on capital
"September 6, 1983",54,
"",,murder and was arraigned the next day.
"September 12, 1983",54,"Hatcher pleaded not guilty and another trial was set for January 9, 1984."
"",,Hatcher was sentenced to life in prison in Missouri State Penitentiary for
"October 13, 1983",54,"the murder of Eric Christgen. Melvin Reynolds, the man currently serving"
"",,time for the crime was released the next day.
"",,"The trial for Michelle Steele’s murder was about to start, but Hatcher’s"
"January 9, 1984",54,
"",,"attorney, Dahms had enough of his client’s abuse and dropped the case."
"",,"The trial and the new attorney moved to Warrensburg, Kansas.  The trial"
"September 17, 1984",55,lasted five days from 9:00 am until 9:00pm.A jury of 8 men and 4
"",,women were picked the 1st day.
"",,Hatcher was convicted of capital murder in the case of Michelle Steele. It
"Sept  22, 1984",55,took the jury less than an hour to return and recommend Hatcher be
"",,sentenced to life without the possibility of probation or parole for 50 years.
"",,Holtslag met with Hatcher for the last time in the penitentiary interview
November 1984,55,
"",,room.
"",,Hatcher appeared before the court again on a motion for a new trial.  The
"December 3, 1984",55,
"",,motion was denied.
"",,"On a clear and cold morning, officers made their routine schedule and"
"",,shined a flashlight in Hatcher’s cell and found him hanged in his cell. He
"",,was hanging by a piece of electrical wire that had been tied to the brace of
"December 7, 1984",55,a heavy metal ventilation grate on his cell.  The knot in the wire was
"",,located beneath his right ear.  Hatcher’s hands had been tied behind his
"",,"back with a piece of shoelace.  The officers tried to revive him, but he was"
"",,already dead.
"",,A group of volunteers carried a fiberboard box containing Hatcher’s
"December 11, 1984",55,
"",,remains to the prison cemetery to be buried.  His brother refused to have

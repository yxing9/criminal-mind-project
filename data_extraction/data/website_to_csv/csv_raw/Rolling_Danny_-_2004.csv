Claudia married James Rolling when she was only 19-years old.
James was a local police officer who beat his wife on occasion.
"Claudia was found with child two weeks into the couple’s marriage,"
1953
"which angered James. Throughout the pregnancy, husband James"
"beat Claudia. Claudia left James, but returned to continue the"
marriage.
"Danny Rolling was born in Shreveport, Louisiana following a"
"difficult delivery, which consisted of the use of forceps. Danny was"
05/26/1954 0
"the older of two sons. Following Danny’s birth, James was verbally"
"abusive to Danny, because James did not want children."
The first incidence of physical abuse towards Danny was when
Nov. 1955 1 Danny started crawling. James did not like the way that his son was
crawling and beat him.
Danny’s mother gave birth to a second son Kevin. James seemed to
08/15/1955 1
be more violent towards Danny after the birth of Danny’s brother.
1958 4 Claudia left James due to the abuse. Claudia stayed away for six
"",,months until she listed to James’ pleas and returned home.
"",,Several things took place at this point in time. Danny’s father tied
"",,him up about six times in a six-month time period. In another
"",,"situation, Danny tried stealing a candy bar, but was caught by his"
"",,parents and made to return to the store and apologize to the owner.
Dec. 1959,,James found a puppy while at work and took the dog home. Danny
"",5,became fond of the dog and was glad to have something to confide
"",,"in. James constantly beat the dog, according to Danny and"
"",,"neighbors. James later killed the dog by repeated torture, and the"
"",,dog actually died in Danny’s arms.
"",,This is the first reported case of James refusing to hug or show
1959,,affection to his son Danny. James believed hugging was sissy stuff
"",,and refused to hug his own son.
"",,"Now living in Columbus, Claudia left James again because of his"
"",,violent behavior. They eventually got back together and moved to
"",,Shreveport. Claudia admitted later in court that Danny was
1962,8,
"",,suffering physical abuse at least once or twice a week at the hands
"",,of his father. The children were not allowed to have birthdays or
"",,holidays.
"",,"Because the violence was so bad, Claudia left James again with"
12/25/1963,,"both boys. She packed the Christmas tree in the car and left, but she"
"",,did not stay gone long.
"",,Claudia suffered from a nervous breakdown. Danny failed the third
"",,grade for repeatedly missing school due to illnesses. School
"",9,counselors described Danny as “suffering from an inferiority
"",,"complex, with aggressive tendencies and poor impulse control.” It"
1963,,
"",,"was recommended that Danny receive counseling, but he never did."
"",,"Claudia again left with the boys, but she went back to James two"
"",,weeks later. Danny began to use his artistic talent he shared with his
"",,mother to create a world of his own.
"",,"In an attempt to teach the boys how to drive, James slapped Danny"
"",,in the face and berated him for not knowing how to use the clutch.
1964,10,"Danny failed the third grade again. During this time, Claudia left"
"",,"James once again, and Danny begged his mother not to return"
"",,home.
"",,Danny walked in on his parents having an argument. His mother slit
"",,her wrists with a razor and then locked herself in the bathroom.
"",,James knocked down the door and continued to argue with Claudia.
"",,Rolling watched as his mother laid on the floor bleeding. Claudia
"",,was committed to a hospital. Danny tried to stop his father from
1965,11,
"",,"beating his mother, and in return, was beaten for interfering."
"",,Danny began to play the guitar and would sing his prayers. He
"",,started to fantasize about sadistic violence. The fantasies became
"",,more sexually violent. Danny began to have a serious alcohol
"",,problem. He stole the alcohol or got it from friends.
"",12,James beat Danny for not receiving a hair cut for school. He beat
"",,Danny with a belt buckle and shaved his head. Kids teased him as a
"",,result and called him names such as “Sasquatch” or “Bigfoot.”
"",,Danny’s father attempted to kill his mother.
"",,Danny’s father found him drinking with a friend. Danny was
"",,dragged home by the neck and thrown in jail for two weeks. Danny
"",,refused to talk to his mother. He grabbed a nap sack and ran away
Sept. 1966,,
"",,from home. Danny spent his first night in the nearby woods. He
"",,masturbated to fantasies of killing people and controlling them. He
"",,returned home when hunger overwhelmed him.
"",,"Danny and his brother, Kevin, were handcuffed together on the"
"",,floor after not cutting the grass to their father’s liking.  While their
1967,13,
"",,"father knelt on their lungs, Danny pleaded with him to stop and"
"",,threatened suicide.
"",,Danny saw a naked girl for the first time and began peeking
"",,through a neighbor’s bathroom window and was caught twice by
"",,neighbors.  Father caught Danny and beat him up on the ground.
"",,"Danny was still being beat by his father and attempted suicide, but"
1968,14,
"",,failed.  Danny had dreams of people beating and torturing him with
"",,demons going through him.  Danny was thrown out of his home by
"",,his father after a fight over whether he could wear jeans to church.
"",,Danny’s mother snuck him back home at night.
"",,Danny got a guitar for Christmas and taught himself to play and
"",,"write his own songs.  Danny got a job at Dairy Queen, which he"
12/25/1969,15,had to quit after a week because his father made him after Danny’s
"",,grades dropped.  Danny became more dark and aggressive.
"",,Danny was thrown in jail after his father caught him drinking with a
1970,16,
"",,neighbor.
"",,"Danny hunted and killed many animals, including shooting a snake,"
02/17/1971,,
"",,and was arrested again for intoxication.
"",,Danny threatened his father that if he did not sign him up for the
03/01/1971,,"Navy, he would run away from home for good.  He had dropped out"
"",,"of high school by this time, but received his high school equivalent."
"",17,
"",,Danny failed the Navy enlistment test and joined the Air Force in
"",,Lackland Air Force Base in Texas. He worked Security police and
06/28/1971,,"Strategic Air Command at Homestead AFB, Florida.  Became"
"",,"Airman First Class Rolling, tripped on acid over 100 times, and did"
"",,other drugs.
"",,Danny was locked up for a drug possession charge and for
"",,"disobeying orders, lost stripe, and was diagnosed by a psychiatrist"
1972,18,as having a personality disorder.  He was forced to leave under
"",,honorable discharge.  Lost virginity when high off LSD and
"",,regretted it the next morning.
"",,"After discharge, returned to Shreveport to live with grandfather and"
"",,found religion at Pentecostal Church.  Danny was baptized and
1973,19,
"",,became involved in many church activities.  Met Omatha Ann
"",,"Halko, who he thought God gave to him."
09/06/1974,20,"Married Omatha Ann Halko, who was pregnant."
"",,"Daughter Kiley Danielle was born, and Danny began to feel the"
"",,pressure of working 2 jobs to support them.  Danny began drinking
1975,21,"and smoking marijuana again, left church and acted so irrational"
"",,that Omatha became afraid of him (he would threaten her life).
"",,Danny would run off for hours or days without telling her anything.
"",,Danny was caught peeking in windows and returned home to his
"",,"wife by an officer. Danny claimed he saw weird things (UFO,"
1976,22,"demons, Jesus, ghosts).  His wife called his parents when he"
"",,stopped going to work and his father came to the house and put a
"",,knife to his throat.
"",,Danny put a gun to his wife’s head when she said she was going to
"",,leave him.  He threatened to kill her and ex-boyfriend when he
"",,caught them having an affair.  Beat up ex-boyfriend and Omatha
"",,"after she threatened to leave him, then turned the gun on himself;"
1977,23,she begged him to stop.  Omatha filed for separation and this was
"",,devastating to him.  They were divorced six months later. Danny
"",,committed his first rape on a woman who resembled Omatha.
"",,Danny got in bad car accident that resulted in a woman’s death and
"",,was tormented by this incident.
"",,"Danny became suicidal, but could not complete the act.  He started"
"",,to date Mary Lynn (17) and went to church with her.  Danny began
1978,,
"",,"to commit numerous robberies, and wished he were shot while"
"",24,
"",,committing these crimes.
"",,"He robbed a Winn Dixie supermarket in Montgomery, Alabama of"
05/25/1979,,
"",,$800.00
"",,"He robbed another Winn Dixie in Columbus, Georgia. Half of an"
05/31/1979,,"hour later, he was arrested by three officers and confessed to the"
"",,"armed robberies in Alabama, Georgia, and Louisiana."
"",,Danny was sentenced to two concurrent 6 year terms for armed
"",,"robberies. The first time his mother saw him in prison, she"
07/31/1979,,"described him as thin and distressed.  By her second visit, he had"
"",,put on weight and was bodybuilding. He seemed to have learned to
"",,cope with prison life.
"",25,
"",,Danny was processed into the Georgia prison system at the Medical
08/20/1979,,
"",,"Classification Canter in Jackson, Georgia."
"",,He escaped from a road gang while they were chopping down tress.
10/08/1979,,He surrendered about 100 yards from the prison’s boundaries after
"",,an officer fired a warning shot.
"",,He was sent to Reidsville prison for about 6 months. He was almost
05/13/1980,,raped there. He also tried to kill a cat that hung around the prison by
"",,throwing a rock at it.
"",26,"After 6 months in Reidsville, Alabama picked him up and"
"",,extradited him to Montgomery to stand trial for the robbery he
"",,committed a year earlier. His lawyer had him sent to Bryce Mental
"",,institution for 2 or 3 months. Doctors concluded he was sane and
"",,sent him back to the Montgomery County Jail.
"",26,He was caught trying to escape again and sent to the The Hole for
"",,several weeks. He spent Thanksgiving in the Hole for fighting.
"",,"Next, he was sent to the St. Clair County Jail to finish up his"
"",,sentence. He was a trustee there and ran off after dumping the
"",,"garbage one afternoon. He made it out of Alabama, but was caught"
"",,"3 days later in Natchitoches, Louisiana. Danny was immediately"
"",,sent back to the Alabama Classification Center. He remained there
"",,for 3 months until being sent to the Staten Correctional Facility. He
"",,earned a good reputation there as a boxer; he never lost a fight. He
"",,saw his first and only total eclipse of the sun at Staten.
"",,Danny was released from the Alabama Prison. He retuned to
"",,Shreveport to see his mother and father. He stayed there a short
06/07/1984,,
"",,time until he and James got into another fight. He then stayed with
"",,his Aunt Agnes until eventually returning to his parents.
"",,Danny broke into a young girl’s home after watching her for several
"",,"hours. His intent was to rape her, but she started crying and he felt"
"",,"bad. He decided not to rape her. Instead, they talked, had a cup of"
Nov 1984,,
"",30,"coffee, sang songs to each other, and then engaged in consensual"
"",,sex. She took him home and then he fled town in fear that she
"",,would call the police.
"",,"Danny traveled to Camarillo, California to visit his aunt, uncle, and"
"",,"cousin. He then hitchhiked all around for about 6 or 7 months,"
01/15/1985,,visiting more family in Florida. He then moved in with his aunt and
"",,"uncle in California for 3 months. He left abruptly, claiming he had"
"",,to see his daughter back in Shreveport.
"",,He got in a motorcycle accident and was treated for a concussion
"",,and nerve damage to his neck. He hitch hiked a ride from Camarillo
"",,"to Boulder, Colorado and stayed there for about 2 weeks. He then"
"",,traveled to the Black Hills of South Dakota for approximately 2
"",,"weeks and continued on to Columbus, Georgia for another month."
07/22/1985,,He robbed a Kroger supermarket of $290.
"",31,
"",,Danny stole the keys to the family’s car and took off in it. Police
07/23/1985,,
"",,arrested him the following morning.
"",,Danny Rolling pled guilty to the Kroger robbery and was sentenced
03/20/1986,,
"",,to 4 years in the Jackson County Jail.
"",,He escaped from the jail by simply walking off and swimming the
04/15/1986,,
"",,"Snake River that ran through Jackson, Mississippi."
"",,Danny was paroled from the Mississippi Penitentiary under the
07/19/1988,32,conditions that he return to Shreveport. He did not have much
"",,success in finding a job.
"",,Danny was fired from work. His boss claimed that he missed three
11/04/1989,35,"consecutive days of work and when we he was confronted about it,"
"",,exploded in a fit of rage and threatened to kill the manger and cook.
"",,"The bodies of three victims were found. Julie Grissom (24), her"
"",35,
11/06/1989,,"father Tom Grissom, and her nephew, Sean (8). The medical"
"",,examiner estimated the time of death to be two days prior-the day
"",,Danny Rolling lost his job.
"",,Danny and James Rolling were fighting. Danny left to wander the
"",,streets. He came upon a house where he had watched a woman
"",,undress before and broke in. No one was home. While waiting for
12/24/1989,,"her to return, he watched television, listened to her stereo, and"
"",,sampled her vast collection of alcohol. She never came back so he
"",,"stole about $30 worth of dimes, a fifth of Chivas Regal, and a .38"
"",,caliber revolver.
"",,Danny got into a fight with his father. He shot James once in the
05/18/1990,,
"",,stomach and again in the forehead.
"",,Danny broke into the home of Michael Kennedy and stole 2
"",36,
06/02/1990,,handguns and the identification papers of the deceased Michael
"",,

"",,"Danny robbed Westwood United superstore, getting away with"
06-12-1990,,"$1661.00 He was videotaped telling witnesses, “Thank you...God"
"",,bless...please pray for me...God knows I need it.”
"",,Danny returned to the Westward United Superstore and stole
06-30-1990,,
"",,"$2,001.00."
"",,Danny made collect calls to Shreveport in which he described
07-09-1990,,hiding in the woods and evading police. He smoked cocaine for the
"",,first time.
"",,"Danny took a bus to Sarasota, Florida. It was there that he began his"
07-22-1990,,
"",,"transition into Michael Kennedy, Jr."
"",,"Danny Rolling checked in a local hotel under the assumed name,"
08-23-1990,,"Michael Kennedy, Jr. He set up camp in a wooded area within two"

1990,,

"",,automatic pistol and knife. He covered her mouth with duct tape
"",,and stabbed Sonja Larson (17) to death. He next taped Christina
"",,Powell’s (17) mouth and bound her hands. He removed her clothes
08-24-1990,,and fondled her. He forced her to perform oral sex on him and then
"",,"he raped her. Next, he stabbed her 5 times, killing her. He returned"
"",,to Sonja’s body and raped her again. He fled their apartment
"",,"throwing all evidence in a dumpster. While riding away on his bike,"
"",,he began to feel ill and found one of the girl’s nipples in his bag.
"",,Danny killed Christa Hoyt (18). The beheaded body sat upright at
08-25-1990,,the edge of her bed. Her nipples lay beside her. Her head sat on a
"",,shelf across the room.

08-27-1990,,"Toboada (23) and killed both. No mutilations to these bodies,"
